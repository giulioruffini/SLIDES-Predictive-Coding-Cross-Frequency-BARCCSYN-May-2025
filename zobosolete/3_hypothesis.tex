\begin{exampleblock}{The central hypothesis of KT}
An agent has \SEP (i.e., living stronger, more structured experiences) to the extent it has access to {\em encompassing and compressive models}  to interact with the world.  

\vspace{0.5cm}

More specifically,  {\em the \textbf{event of structured experience} arises in the act of running and comparing models with data.}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\textit{Model structure} determines the properties of structured experience. \vspace{0.5cm}

 \vfill
   Models are constructed from information generated as the agent interacts with the external world. Models should account for data generated by the external world and the agent itself---i.e., include a {\em self-model}.

%         {\em Encompassing} refers to the amount of data from the world  successfully matched, and hence   explanatory potential. % Eq., high $\mathcal M$.   %Models need to account for all the data available  to the agent  and do so with little error.
