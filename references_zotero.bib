	abstract = {A great deal of research in the neuroscience of music suggests that neural oscillations synchronize with musical stimuli. Although neural synchronization is a well-studied mechanism underpinning expectation, it has even more far-reaching implications for music. In this Perspective, we survey the literature on the neuroscience of music, including pitch, harmony, melody, tonality, rhythm, metre, groove and affect. We describe how fundamental dynamical principles based on known neural mechanisms can explain basic aspects of music perception and performance, as summarized in neural resonance theory. Building on principles such as resonance, stability, attunement and strong anticipation, we propose that people anticipate musical events not through predictive neural models, but because brain–body dynamics physically embody musical structure. The interaction of certain kinds of sounds with ongoing pattern-forming dynamics results in patterns of perception, action and coordination that we collectively experience as music. Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems. This analysis of empirical findings from the perspective of neurodynamic principles sheds new light on the neuroscience of music and what makes music powerful.},

A relevant property of spectral measures is the alpha peak, which corresponds to the dominant alpha rhythm. Here we studied the spatial distribution of MEG resting state alpha peak frequency and amplitude values in a sample of 27 MCI patients and 24 age-matched healthy controls. Power spectra were reconstructed in source space with linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer. Then, 88 Regions of Interest (ROIs) were defined and an alpha peak per ROI and subject was identified. Statistical analyses were performed at every ROI, accounting for age, sex and educational level. Peak frequency was significantly decreased ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.05) in MCIs in many posterior ROIs. The average peak frequency over all ROIs was 9.68 ± 0.71 Hz for controls and 9.05 ± 0.90 Hz for MCIs and the average normalized amplitude was (2.57 ± 0.59)·10$^{\textrm{−2}}$ for controls and (2.70 ± 0.49)·10$^{\textrm{−2}}$ for MCIs. Age and gender were also found to play a role in the alpha peak, since its frequency was higher in females than in males in posterior ROIs and correlated negatively with age in frontal ROIs. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of peak parameters with hippocampal volume, which is a commonly used marker of early structural AD-related damage. Peak frequency was positively correlated with hippocampal volume in many posterior ROIs. Overall, these findings indicate a pathological alpha slowing in MCI.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) present with similar clinical symptoms of cognitive decline, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms differ. To determine whether clinical electroencephalography (EEG) can provide information relevant to discriminate between these diagnoses, we used quantitative EEG analysis to compare the spectra between non-medicated patients with AD (n=77) and VaD (n=77) and healthy elderly normal controls (NC) (n=77). We use curve-fitting with a combination of a power loss and Gaussian function to model the averaged resting-state spectra of each EEG channel extracting six parameters. We assessed the performance of our model and tested the extracted parameters for group differentiation. We performed regression analysis in a MANCOVA with group, age, gender, and number of epochs as predictors and further explored the topographical group differences with pair-wise contrasts. Significant topographical differences between the groups were found in several of the extracted features. Both AD and VaD groups showed increased delta power when compared to NC, whereas the AD patients showed a decrease in alpha power for occipital and temporal regions when compared with NC. The VaD patients had higher alpha power than NC and AD. The AD and VaD groups showed slowing of the alpha rhythm. Variability of the alpha frequency was wider for both AD and VaD groups. There was a general decrease in beta power for both AD and VaD. The proposed model is a useful to parameterize spectra which allowed extracting relevant clinical EEG key features that move towards simple and interpretable diagnostic criteria.},

Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of \$2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.},

	abstract = {Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage: each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation (UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug that has shown lasting positive effects on clinical symptoms and self-reported well-being following a single dose. There has been little research into the long-term effects of psilocybin on brain connectivity in humans.
AIM: Evaluate changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) at 1 week and 3 months after one psilocybin dose in 10 healthy psychedelic-naïve volunteers and explore associations between change in RSFC and related measures.
METHODS: Participants received 0.2-0.3 mg/kg psilocybin in a controlled setting. Participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline, 1-week and 3-month post-administration and [11C]Cimbi-36 PET scans at baseline and 1 week. We examined changes in within-network, between-network and region-to-region RSFC. We explored associations between changes in RSFC and psilocybin-induced phenomenology as well as changes in psychological measures and neocortex serotonin 2A receptor binding.
RESULTS: Psilocybin was well tolerated and produced positive changes in well-being. At 1 week only, executive control network (ECN) RSFC was significantly decreased (Cohen's d = -1.73, pFWE = 0.010). We observed no other significant changes in RSFC at 1 week or 3 months, nor changes in region-to-region RSFC. Exploratory analyses indicated that decreased ECN RSFC at 1 week predicted increased mindfulness at 3 months (r = -0.65).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings in a small cohort indicate that psilocybin affects ECN function within the psychedelic 'afterglow' period. Our findings implicate ECN modulation as mediating psilocybin-induced, long-lasting increases in mindfulness. Although our findings implicate a neural pathway mediating lasting psilocybin effects, it is notable that changes in neuroimaging measures at 3 months, when personality changes are observed, remain to be identified.},

	abstract = {Interactions among brain rhythms play a crucial role in organizing neuronal firing sequences during specific cognitive functions. In memory formation, the coupling between the phase of the theta rhythm and the amplitude of gamma oscillations has been extensively studied in the hippocampus. Prevailing perspectives suggest that the phase of the slower oscillation modulates the fast activity. However, recent metrics, such as Cross-Frequency Directionality (CFD), indicate that these electrophysiological interactions can be bidirectional. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that feedforward inhibition modeled by a theta-modulated ING (Interneuron Network Gamma) mechanism induces fast-to-slow interactions, while feedback inhibition through a PING (Pyramidal Interneuron Network Gamma) model drives slow-to-fast interactions. Importantly, in circuits combining both feedforward and feedback motifs, as commonly found experimentally, directionality is flexibly modulated by synaptic strength within biologically realistic ranges. A signature of this interaction is that fast-to-slow dominance in feedforward motifs is associated with gamma oscillations of higher frequency, and vice versa. Using previously acquired electrophysiological data from the hippocampus of rats freely navigating in a familiar environment or in a novel one, we show that CFD is dynamically regulated and linked to the frequency of the gamma band, as predicted by the model. Finally, the model attributes each theta-gamma interaction scheme, determined by the balance between feedforward and feedback inhibition, to distinct modes of information transmission and integration, adding computational flexibility. Our results offer a plausible neurobiological interpretation for cross-frequency directionality measurements associated with the activation of different underlying motifs that serve distinct computational needs.
Author Summary This study investigates the interaction between various types of brain oscillations and their potential relationship with the connectivity of underlying neural networks. Brain activity encompasses slow oscillations, such as theta, alpha, and delta, as well as faster oscillations, including gamma. These oscillations interact through Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC), a mechanism essential for cognitive processes like memory, learning, and attention. Given the higher spectral power and broader spatial propagation of slow oscillations, it has been proposed that CFC arises when slow oscillations modulate faster activity. However, recent evidence suggests that gamma oscillations can also predict the phase of slower oscillations, indicating a bidirectional and more intricate relationship. To explore this complexity, we developed a computational model that reproduces both forms of interaction observed experimentally. Our results demonstrate that while slow oscillations originating from distant regions can induce gamma activity, local connectivity and specific cell-type dynamics allow gamma oscillations to anticipate slow oscillations in certain conditions. The balance of inhibitory circuits modulates fast-slow oscillation interactions, creating distinct dynamical modes with varying computational properties and enhancing system flexibility. This work integrates competing hypotheses on oscillation interactions and offers a conceptual framework for linking these dynamics to the structural organization of neural circuits.},

First-person accounts within and outside the medical field were screened and discussed in collaborative workshops involving numerous individuals with lived experience of depression, family members and carers, representing a global network of organizations. The material was enriched by phenomenologically informed perspectives and shared with all collaborators in a cloud-based system. The subjective world of depression was characterized by an altered experience of emotions and body (feeling overwhelmed by negative emotions, unable to experience positive emotions, stuck in a heavy aching body drained of energy, detached from the mind, the body and the world); an altered experience of the self (losing sense of purpose and existential hope, mismatch between the past and the depressed self, feeling painfully incarcerated, losing control over one's thoughts, losing the capacity to act on the world; feeling numb, empty, non-existent, dead, and dreaming of death as a possible escape route); and an altered experience of time (experiencing an alteration of vital biorhythms, an overwhelming past, a stagnation of the present, and the impossibility of the future). The experience of depression in the social and cultural context was characterized by altered interpersonal experiences (struggling with communication, feeling loneliness and estrangement, perceiving stigma and stereotypes), and varied across different cultures, ethnic or racial minorities, and genders. The subjective perception of recovery varied (feeling contrasting attitudes towards recovery, recognizing recovery as a journey, recognizing one's vulnerability and the need for professional help), as did the experience of receiving pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and social as well as physical health interventions. These findings can inform clinical practice, research and education. This journey in the lived experience of depression can also help us to understand the nature of our own emotions and feelings, what is to believe in something, what is to hope, and what is to be a living human being.},

	abstract = {Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is by far the most examined type of psychological treatment for depression and is recommended in most treatment guide­lines. However, no recent meta‐analysis has integrated the results of randomized trials examining its effects, and its efficacy in comparison with other psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and combined treatment for depression remains uncertain. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Library to identify studies on CBT, and separated included trials into several subsets to conduct random‐effects meta‐analyses. We included 409 trials (518 comparisons) with 52,702 patients, thus conducting the largest meta‐analysis ever of a specific type of psychotherapy for a mental disorder. The quality of the trials was found to have increased significantly over time (with increasing numbers of trials with low risk of bias, less waitlist control groups, and larger sample sizes). CBT had moderate to large effects compared to control conditions such as care as usual and waitlist (g=0.79; 95\% CI: 0.70‐0.89), which remained similar in sensitivity analyses and were still significant at 6‐12 month follow‐up. There was no reduction of the effect size of CBT according to the publication year ({\textless}2001 vs. 2001‐2010 vs. {\textgreater}2011). CBT was significantly more effective than other psychotherapies, but the difference was small (g=0.06; 95\% CI: 0‐0.12) and became non‐significant in most sensitivity analyses. The effects of CBT did not differ significantly from those of pharmacotherapies at the short term, but were significantly larger at 6‐12 month follow‐up (g=0.34; 95\% CI: 0.09‐0.58), although the number of trials was small, and the difference was not significant in all sensitivity analyses. Combined treatment was more effective than pharmacotherapies alone at the short (g=0.51; 95\% CI: 0.19‐0.84) and long term (g=0.32; 95\% CI: 0.09‐0.55), but it was not more effective than CBT alone at either time point. CBT was also effective as unguided self‐help intervention (g=0.45; 95\% CI: 0.31‐0.60), in institutional settings (g=0.65; 95\% CI: 0.21‐1.08), and in children and adolescents (g=0.41; 95\% CI: 0.25‐0.57). We can conclude that the efficacy of CBT in depression is documented across different formats, ages, target groups, and settings. However, the superiority of CBT over other psychotherapies for depression does not emerge clearly from this meta‐analysis. CBT appears to be as effective as pharmacotherapies at the short term, but more effective at the longer term.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress of commercial virtual reality (VR) technology, open access to VR development software as well as open-source instructions for creating brain-VR interfaces have increased the number of VR-based neurofeedback (NF) training studies. Controlling a VR environment with brain signals has potential advantages for NF applications. More entertaining, multimodal and adaptive virtual feedback modalities might positively affect subjective user experience and could consequently enhance NF training performance and outcome. Nevertheless, there are certain pitfalls and contraindications that make VR-based NF not suitable for everyone. In the present review, we summarize applications of VR-based NF and discuss positive effects of VR-based NF training as well as contraindications such as cybersickness in VR or age- and sex-related differences. The existing literature implies that VR-based feedback is a promising tool for the improvement of NF training performance. Users generally rate VR-based feedback more positively than traditional 2D feedback, albeit to draw meaningful conclusions and to rule out adverse effects of VR, more research on this topic is necessary. The pace in the development of brain-VR synchronization furthermore necessitates ethical considerations on these technologies.},

	abstract = {Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful artificial intelligence systems.},

	abstract = {As a new type of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT is becoming widely used in learning. However, academic consensus regarding its efficacy remains elusive. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ChatGPT in improving students’ learning performance, learning perception, and higher-order thinking through a meta-analysis of 51 research studies published between November 2022 and February 2025. The results indicate that ChatGPT has a large positive impact on improving learning performance (g = 0.867) and a moderately positive impact on enhancing learning perception (g = 0.456) and fostering higher-order thinking (g = 0.457). The impact of ChatGPT on learning performance was moderated by type of course (QB = 64.249, P {\textless} 0.001), learning model (QB = 76.220, P {\textless} 0.001), and duration (QB = 55.998, P {\textless} 0.001); its effect on learning perception was moderated by duration (QB = 19.839, P {\textless} 0.001); and its influence on the development of higher-order thinking was moderated by type of course (QB = 7.811, P {\textless} 0.05) and the role played by ChatGPT (QB = 4.872, P {\textless} 0.05). This study suggests that: (1) appropriate learning scaffolds or educational frameworks (e.g., Bloom’s taxonomy) should be provided when using ChatGPT to develop students’ higher-order thinking; (2) the broad use of ChatGPT at various grade levels and in different types of courses should be encouraged to support diverse learning needs; (3) ChatGPT should be actively integrated into different learning modes to enhance student learning, especially in problem-based learning; (4) continuous use of ChatGPT should be ensured to support student learning, with a recommended duration of 4–8 weeks for more stable effects; (5) ChatGPT should be flexibly integrated into teaching as an intelligent tutor, learning partner, and educational tool. Finally, due to the limited sample size for learning perception and higher-order thinking, and the moderately positive effect, future studies with expanded scope should further explore how to use ChatGPT more effectively to cultivate students’ learning perception and higher-order thinking.},

It is thought to originate from the comparison between intentions and actions across broad cortical networks. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are still not fully understood. We hypothesized that oscillations in the theta-alpha range, thought to orchestrate long-range neural connectivity, may mediate sensorimotor comparisons. To test this, we manipulated the relation between intentions and actions in a tetraplegic user of a brain machine interface (BMI), decoding primary motor cortex (M1) activity to restore hand functionality. We found that the pre-movement phase of low-alpha oscillations in M1 predicted the participant’s agency judgements. Further, using EEG-BMI in healthy participants, we found that pre-movement alpha oscillations in M1 and supplementary motor area (SMA) correlated with agency ratings, and with changes in their functional connectivity with parietal, temporal and prefrontal areas. These findings argue for phase-driven gating as a key mechanism for sensorimotor integration and sense of agency.},

We link emissions inequality over the period 1990–2020 to regional climate extremes using an emulator-based framework. We find that two-thirds (one-fifth) of warming is attributable to the wealthiest 10\% (1\%), meaning that individual contributions are 6.5 (20) times the average per capita contribution. For extreme events, the top 10\% (1\%) contributed 7 (26) times the average to increases in monthly 1-in-100-year heat extremes globally and 6 (17) times more to Amazon droughts. Emissions from the wealthiest 10\% in the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions. Quantifying the link between wealth disparities and climate impacts can assist in the discourse on climate equity and justice.},

Subclinical cardiovascular functional changes, such as cardiac autonomic dysfunction, precede cardiovascular diseases and improve risk stratification. Continuous monitoring of heart rate or pulse rate is a commonly used approach to evaluate cardiac cycle and autonomic regulation. We investigated whether the complexity of pulse rate is associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in older adults.MethodsOvernight pulse oximetry data were collected from 503 participants (mean age=82±7 [SD] years, 76\% female). We used a previously established distribution entropy algorithm to extract the complexity of pulse rate as a proxy for subclinical cardiovascular function. Participants completed a standardized cognitive test battery during the same visit of pulse oximetry and at least 1 follow‐up visit. Linear mixed‐effects models were conducted to test whether distribution entropy is associated with longitudinal changes in global cognition and separately, in 5 cognitive domains.ResultsGreater distribution entropy (ie, better complexity) was associated with a slower decline in global cognition; the effect of 1‐SD increase in distribution entropy was equivalent to being approximately 3 years younger. No associations were observed between conventional time‐ or frequency‐domain pulse rate variability measures and cognitive changes.ConclusionsHigher complexity of pulse rate is linked with slower cognitive decline in older adults. Future studies should test whether complexity is also associated with future risks of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia, and further elucidate the causal directions.},

Here we show that a major mode of these brain–body cofluctuations can be captured by a single spatiotemporal pattern. Across several independent samples, as well as single-echo and multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition sequences, we identify widespread cofluctuations in the low-frequency range (0.01–0.1 Hz) between resting-state global fMRI signals, electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, and a host of peripheral autonomic signals spanning cardiovascular, pulmonary, exocrine and smooth muscle systems. The same brain–body cofluctuations observed at rest are elicited by cued deep breathing and intermittent sensory stimuli, as well as spontaneous phasic EEG events during sleep. Furthermore, we show that the spatial structure of global fMRI signals is maintained under experimental suppression of end-tidal carbon dioxide variations, suggesting that respiratory-driven fluctuations in arterial CO2 accompanying arousal cannot fully explain the origin of these signals in the brain. These findings suggest that the global fMRI signal is a substantial component of the arousal response governed by the autonomic nervous system. The brain and body are necessarily connected. Here the authors show that brain blood flow and electrical activity are coupled with systemic physiological changes in the body.},

	abstract = {The electroencephalographic alpha rhythm is one of the most robustly observed and widely studied empirical phenomena in all of neuroscience. However, despite its extensive implication in a wide range of cognitive processes and clinical pathologies, the mechanisms underlying alpha generation in neural circuits remain poorly understood. In this paper we offer a renewed foundation for research on this question, by undertaking a systematic comparison and synthesis of the most prominent theoretical models of alpha rhythmogenesis in the published literature. We focus on four models, each studied intensively by multiple authors over the past three decades: (i) Jansen-Rit, (ii) Moran-David-Friston, (iii) Robinson-Rennie-Wright, and (iv) Liley-Wright. Several common elements are identified, such as the use of second-order differential equations and sigmoidal potential-to-rate operators to represent population-level neural activity. Major differences are seen in other features such as wiring topologies and conduction delays. Through a series of mathematical analyses and numerical simulations, we nevertheless demonstrate that the selected models can be meaningfully compared, by associating parameters and circuit motifs of analogous biological significance. With this established, we conduct explorations of rate constant and synaptic connectivity parameter spaces, with the aim of identifying common patterns in key behaviours, such as the role of excitatory-inhibitory interactions in the generation of oscillations. Finally, using linear stability analysis we identify two qualitatively different alpha-generating dynamical regimes across the models: (i) noise-driven fluctuations and (ii) self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations, emerging due to an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. The comprehensive survey and synthesis developed here can, we suggest, be used to help guide future theoretical and experimental work aimed at disambiguating these and other candidate theories of alpha rhythmogenesis.},

It remains unknown how motor learning shapes the way in which upstream regions activate M1 circuits to execute learned movements. Here, using longitudinal axonal imaging of the main inputs to M1 L2/3 in mice, we show that the motor thalamus is the key input source that encodes learned movements in experts (animals trained for two weeks). We then use optogenetics to identify the subset of M1 L2/3 neurons that are strongly driven by thalamic inputs before and after learning. We find that the thalamic influence on M1 changes with learning, such that the motor thalamus preferentially activates the M1 neurons that encode learned movements in experts. Inactivation of the thalamic inputs to M1 in experts impairs learned movements. Our study shows that motor learning reshapes the thalamic influence on M1 to enable the reliable execution of learned movements.},

Because it is relatively new, surgical pearls and operative techniques optimized from experience beyond a small case series have yet to be described.
OBJECTIVE: To provide a detailed description of our operative technique and surgical pearls learned from implantation of the RNS System in 57 patients at our institution. We describe our method for frame-based placement of amygdalo-hippocampal depth leads, open implantation of cortical strip leads, and open installation of the neurostimulator.
METHODS: We outline considerations for patient selection, preoperative planning, surgical positioning, incision planning, stereotactic depth lead implantation, cortical strip lead implantation, craniotomy for neurostimulator implantation, device testing, closure, and intraoperative imaging.
RESULTS: The median reduction in clinical seizure frequency was 60\% (standard deviation 63.1) with 27\% of patients achieving seizure freedom at last follow up (median 23.1 mo). No infections, intracerebral hemorrhages, or lead migrations were encountered. Two patients experienced lead fractures, and four lead exchanges have been performed.
CONCLUSION: The techniques set forth here will help with the safe and efficient implantation of these new devices.},

	abstract = {Serotonergic psychedelics profoundly alter high-order cognition, emotion, and sensory perception, creating dynamic, unpredictable brain states consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis. Although these acute effects are short-lived, users often experience lasting improvements in emotional and social functioning. Yet, few studies have quantitatively linked subjective experiences to neural dynamics. To bridge this gap, we investigate the acute and subacute effects of ayahuasca using fMRI data and the 2D Ising model, estimating the Ising brain temperature to quantify the shift from ordered to disordered resting state configurations and expose the critical transitions that characterize ayahuasca-induced brain dynamics. To complement our analysis, we investigated cortical functional connectivity changes through graph-theoretical metrics, quantifying how psychedelic ingestion alters functional network architecture in acute and subacute phases. Only the Ising temperature reliably differentiated the subacute phase. Applying a recently developed method that combines cortical connectivity analyses with Graph Neural Networks trained on Ising networks, our results robustly revealed significant Ising temperature increases during the acute (p {\textless} 0.001) and subacute (p {\textless} 0.05) phases compared with placebo, reflecting heightened brain entropy and a persistent shift toward a more disordered, paramagnetic state. To evaluate longer-term effects, the subacute temperature change correlated linearly with affective scores on the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale (HRS) captured during the acute session (p {\textless} 0.01), with HRS scores explaining substantially greater variance in the subacute group (adjusted R2 = 0.58) than in the placebo group (adjusted R2 = –0.05). These observations suggest that ayahuasca elevates system entropy and that the magnitude of lasting functional alterations scales with the intensity of the acute subjective experience.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four wellused morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.},

It is described in terms of symbol manipulation over formal language. This approach is connected with a variety of unsolvable problems, as pointed out by Thagard. In this paper, I argue that the main reason for the inadequacy of the traditional view of cognition is that it detaches the body of a human as the cognizing agent from the higher-level abstract knowledge generation. It neglects the dynamical aspects of cognitive processes, emotions, consciousness, and social aspects of cognition. It is also uninterested in other cognizing agents such as other living beings or intelligent machines. Contrary to the traditional computationalism in cognitive science, the morphological computation approach offers a framework that connects low-level with high-level approaches to cognition, capable of meeting challenges listed by Thagard. To establish this connection, morphological computation generalizes the idea of computation from symbol manipulation to natural/physical computation and the idea of cognition from the exclusively human capacity to the capacity of all goal-directed adaptive self-reflective systems, living organisms as well as robots. Cognition is modeled as a layered process, where at the lowest level, systems acquire data from the environment, which in combination with the already stored data in the morphology of an agent, presents the basis for further structuring and self-organization of data into information and knowledge.},

These latter cases are not, however, specific enough: all computational systems, not only morphological ones, may (and sometimes should) be studied in various ways, including their energy efficiency, cost, reliability, and durability. Second, I critically analyze the notion of “offloading” computation to the morphology of an agent or robot, by showing that, literally, computation is sometimes not offloaded but simply avoided. Third, I point out that while the morphology of any agent is indicative of the environment that it is adapted to, or informative about that environment, it does not follow that every agent has access to its morphology as the model of its environment.},

DDPMs can generate realistic synthetic data for a variety of datasets from different species and recording techniques. The generated data capture important statistics, such as frequency spectra and phase-amplitude coupling, as well as fine-grained features such as sharp wave ripples. Furthermore, data can be generated based on additional information such as experimental conditions. We demonstrate the flexibility of DDPMs in several applications, including brain-state classification and missing-data imputation. In summary, DDPMs can serve as accurate generative models of neurophysiological recordings and have broad utility in the probabilistic generation of synthetic recordings for neuroscientific applications.},

	abstract = {Musical rhythm, consisting of apparently abstract intervals of accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second, we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental, survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future events. According to this theory, perception and learning is manifested through the brain’s Bayesian minimization of the error between the input to the brain and the brain’s prior expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm, in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction between what is heard (“rhythm”) and the brain’s anticipatory structuring of music (“meter”). Finally, we review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain’s general principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a result of such mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Entrainment of cortical rhythms to acoustic rhythms has been hypothesized to be the neural correlate of pulse and meter perception in music. Dynamic attending theory first proposed synchronization of endogenous perceptual rhythms nearly 40 years ago, but only recently has the pivotal role of neural synchrony been demonstrated. Significant progress has since been made in understanding the role of neural oscillations and the neural structures that support synchronized responses to musical rhythm. Synchronized neural activity has been observed in auditory and motor networks, and has been linked with attentional allocation and movement coordination. Here we describe a neurodynamic model that shows how self-organization of oscillations in interacting sensory and motor networks could be responsible for the formation of the pulse percept in complex rhythms. In a pulse synchronization study, we test the model's key prediction that pulse can be perceived at a frequency for which no spectral energy is present in the amplitude envelope of the acoustic rhythm. The result shows that participants perceive the pulse at the theoretically predicted frequency. This model is one of the few consistent with neurophysiological evidence on the role of neural oscillation, and it explains a phenomenon that other computational models fail to explain. Because it is based on a canonical model, the predictions hold for an entire family of dynamical systems, not only a specific one. Thus, this model provides a theoretical link between oscillatory neurodynamics and the induction of pulse and meter in musical rhythm.},

Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference. We review a body of work applying active inference models to the study of consciousness and argue that there is implicit in all these models a small set of theoretical commitments that point to a minimal (and testable) theory of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia1–5. Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects6–9. Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01\% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2\% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0\% (95\% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system10. Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.},

	abstract = {Neural oscillations play a fundamental role in human cognition and behavior. While electroencephalography (EEG) and related methods provide precise temporal recordings of these oscillations, they are limited in their ability to generate causal conclusions. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive neurostimulation technique to modulate neural oscillations, which offers insights into their functional role and relation to human cognition and behavior. Originally, tACS is applied between two or more electrodes at a given frequency. However, recent advances have aimed to apply different current waveforms to target specific oscillatory dynamics. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of non-standard tACS applications designed to investigate oscillatory patterns beyond simple sinusoidal stimulation. We categorized these approaches into three key domains: (1) phase synchronization techniques, including in-phase, anti-phase, and traveling wave stimulation; (2) non-sinusoidal tACS, which applies alternative waveforms such as composite, broadband or triangular oscillations; and (3) amplitude-modulated tACS and temporal interference stimulation, which allow for concurrent EEG recordings and deeper cortical targeting. While a number of studies provide evidence for the added value of these non-standard tACS procedures, other studies show opposing or null findings. Crucially, the number of studies for most applications is currently low, and as such, the goal of this review is to highlight both the promise and current limitations of these techniques, providing a foundation for future research in neurostimulation.},

Systemic administration of distinct antidepressant drugs similarly restores autophagy function in the LHb, suggesting LHb autophagy as a common antidepressant target. Genetic ablation of LHb neuronal autophagy promotes stress susceptibility, whereas enhancing LHb autophagy exerts rapid antidepressant-like effects. LHb autophagy controls neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity by means of on-demand degradation of glutamate receptors. Collectively, this study shows a causal role of LHb autophagy in maintaining emotional homeostasis against stress. Disrupted LHb autophagy is implicated in the maladaptation to chronic stress, and its reversal by autophagy enhancers provides a new antidepressant strategy.},

	abstract = {Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity1,2. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared3. Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT)4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT)6–10 via a theory-neutral consortium11–13. The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof12. Human participants (n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here14–17. Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.},

This view is challenged by the predictive coding model in recent years due to the robust evidence researchers had found on how our prediction could influence perception. In the first half of this article, we reviewed the concept of predictive brain and some empirical evidence of sensory prediction in visual and auditory processing. The predictive function along the auditory pathway was mainly studied by mismatch negativity (MMN)—a brain response to an unexpected disruption of regularity. We summarized a range of MMN paradigms and discussed how they could contribute to the theoretical development of the predictive coding neural network by the mechanism of adaptation and deviance detection. Such methodological and conceptual evolution sharpen MMN as a tool to better understand the structural and functional brain abnormality for neuropsychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Psilocybin therapy (PT) is emerging as an effective intervention for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), offering comparable efficacy to conventional treatments like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Music, an emotionally evocative stimulus, provides a valuable tool to explore changes in hedonic and predictive processing mechanisms via expectancy violations, or ‘surprises’. This study sought to compare behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to musical surprises in MDD patients treated with either PT or the SSRI, escitalopram. In this secondary analysis of a trial, 41 MDD patients (with usable fMRI data) were randomly assigned to either PT (n = 22) or escitalopram (n = 19) treatment groups. Participants listened to music during fMRI and tracked their emotional experience, both before and after a 6-week intervention. Surprise-related valence and arousal indices were calculated. Musical surprises were entered as regressors for whole-brain and region of interest fMRI analyses. PT caused a greater decrease in anhedonia scores compared with escitalopram. While escitalopram led to reductions in surprise-related affective responses, PT showed no significant change. Escitalopram was associated with increased activation in memory and emotional processing areas during musical surprises (versus control events) when compared with PT. Following PT, there was greater activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and sensory regions, and reduced activation in the angular gyrus. PT may allow for the subjective response to musical surprises to be maintained through a lasting reduction in the salience of prediction errors, or, alternatively, by increasing hedonic priors. Contrastingly, escitalopram may diminish hedonic priors, highlighting fundamental differences in treatment mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex dynamical system which displays a wide range of macroscopic and mesoscopic patterns of neural activity, whose mechanistic origin remains poorly understood. Whole-brain modelling allows us to explore candidate mechanisms causing the observed patterns. However, it is not fully established how the choice of model type and the networks' resolution influence the simulation results, hence, it remains unclear, to which extent conclusions drawn from these results are limited by modelling artefacts. Here, we compare the dynamics of a biophysically realistic, linear-nonlinear cascade model of whole-brain activity with a phenomenological Wilson-Cowan model using three structural connectomes based on the Schaefer parcellation scheme with 100, 200, and 500 nodes. Both neural mass models implement the same mechanistic hypotheses, which specifically address the interaction between excitation, inhibition, and a slow adaptation current, which affects the excitatory populations. We quantify the emerging dynamical states in detail and investigate how consistent results are across the different model variants. Then we apply both model types to the specific phenomenon of slow oscillations, which are a prevalent brain rhythm during deep sleep. We investigate the consistency of model predictions when exploring specific mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of both short- and long-range connections and of the antero-posterior structural connectivity gradient on key properties of these oscillations. Overall, our results demonstrate that the coarse-grained dynamics are robust to changes in both model type and network resolution. In some cases, however, model predictions do not generalize. Thus, some care must be taken when interpreting model results.},

Pain severity is often measured through subjective report, while objective biomarkers that may guide diagnosis and treatment are lacking.

Here four individuals with refractory neuropathic pain were implanted with chronic intracranial electrodes in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Participants reported pain metrics coincident with ambulatory, direct neural recordings obtained multiple times daily over months. We successfully predicted intraindividual chronic pain severity scores from neural activity with high sensitivity using machine learning methods. Chronic pain decoding relied on sustained power changes from the OFC, which tended to differ from transient patterns of activity associated with acute, evoked pain states during a task. Thus, intracranial OFC signals can be used to predict spontaneous, chronic pain state in patients.},

	abstract = {Tau aggregation in early affected regions in the asymptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s disease marks a transitional phase between stable asymptomatic amyloid positivity and the clinically manifest stage. How this early region tau aggregation covertly affects brain function during this asymptomatic stage remains unclear. In this study, 83 participants underwent a 128 electrodes resting-state EEG, a dynamic 100 min tau PET scan (18F-MK6240), an amyloid PET scan, a structural T1 MRI scan and neuropsychological assessment. Tau PET data quality control led to a final sample of 66 subjects. Based on the clinical and cognitive status, amyloid and tau PET biomarkers, the group was composed of 37 cognitively unimpaired amyloid negative subjects, 14 cognitively unimpaired amyloid positive subjects and 15 patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. We calculated the average undirected weighted Phase Lag Index in the alpha frequency band with eyes closed and used this as weights for the graph and analysed the global clustering coefficient and characteristic path length in sensor space. As a primary objective, we assessed how these global graph measures correlated with tau PET values, in an a priori defined early metaVOI, comprised of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampus and fusiform cortex. As secondary analyses, we investigated which specific brain regions were mainly implicated, what the contribution was of amyloid, the effect of electrode density and the relation to cognitive performance. In the overall group and within the cognitively unimpaired amyloid positive subgroup, tau aggregation was associated with a decrease in global clustering coefficient and an increase in characteristic path length. These changes reflect the initial disintegration of the small-world brain network during the transitional phase, even before clinical symptoms are apparent. The correlations are most prominent in the perirhinal cortex, indicating that global deterioration of the network is already present early in the Alzheimer’s disease pathology. We obtained similar results with only taking 64 electrodes into account. To conclude, we found that in the asymptomatic stage of Alzheimer’s disease, tau PET load in medial temporal cortex is associated with global electrophysiological measures of network disintegration. The study demonstrates the potential value of high-density EEG in the era of biologically defined Alzheimer’s disease for characterizing brain function in the asymptomatic stage.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive studies at the genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels, the underlying mechanisms regulating longevity are incompletely understood. Post-translational protein acetylation is suggested to regulate aspects of longevity. To further explore the role of acetylation, we develop the PHARAOH computational tool based on the 100-fold differences in longevity within the mammalian class. Analyzing acetylome and proteome data across 107 mammalian species identifies 482 and 695 significant longevity-associated acetylated lysine residues in mice and humans, respectively. These sites include acetylated lysines in short-lived mammals that are replaced by permanent acetylation or deacetylation mimickers, glutamine or arginine, respectively, in long-lived mammals. Conversely, glutamine or arginine residues in short-lived mammals are replaced by reversibly acetylated lysine in long-lived mammals. Pathway analyses highlight the involvement of mitochondrial translation, cell cycle, fatty acid oxidation, transsulfuration, DNA repair and others in longevity. A validation assay shows that substituting lysine 386 with arginine in mouse cystathionine beta synthase, to attain the human sequence, increases the pro-longevity activity of this enzyme. Likewise, replacing the human ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 acetylated lysine 714 with arginine as in short-lived mammals, reduces its anti-neoplastic function.

	abstract = {Psychedelics can profoundly alter consciousness by reorganising brain connectivity; however, their effects are context-sensitive. To understand how this reorganisation depends on the context, we collected and comprehensively analysed the largest psychedelic neuroimaging dataset to date. Sixty-two adults were scanned with functional MRI and EEG during rest and naturalistic stimuli (meditation, music, and visual), before and after ingesting 19 mg of psilocybin. Half of the participants ranked the experience among the five most meaningful of their lives. Under psilocybin, functional MRI and EEG signals recorded during eyes-closed conditions became similar to those recorded during an eyes-open condition. This change manifested as an increase in global functional connectivity in associative regions and a decrease in sensory areas. We used machine learning to directly link the subjective effects of psychedelics to neural activity patterns characterised by low-dimensional embeddings. We show that psilocybin reorganised these low-dimensional trajectories into cohesive patterns of brain activity that were structured by context and quality of subjective experience, with stronger self- and boundary-related effects–which were linked to day-after mindset changes—leading to more structured and distinct neural representations. This reorganisation induces a state of ‘embeddedness’ that arises when brain networks that usually segregate internal and external processing coherently integrate, aligning neural dynamics with context. This state corresponded to profound transformations of perception and self-boundaries, reducing the distinction between self and environment. Embeddedness serves as a bridging framework for understanding both the subjective and therapeutic effects of psychedelics. These findings provide a new account of the large-scale neurocognitive effects of psychedelics and demonstrate the utility of using machine learning methods in assessing state- and context-dependent neural dynamics and their association with psychological outcomes.},

Yet, our understanding of the relationship between reasoning abilities and their neuroanatomical basis remains surprisingly limited. We aimed to conduct fine-grained anatomical mapping of performance on tests of AR, DR and fluid intelligence (Gf), in a large sample of patients with unilateral focal frontal or posterior lesions and healthy controls.We assessed 247 prospectively recruited patients using two new tests: the Analogical Reasoning Test (ART) and the Deductive Reasoning Test (DRT); and the best-established measure of Gf: Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM). Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling was used to reveal the community structure of lesion deficit networks, disentangling functional from confounding pathological distributed effects.ART and DRT performance was significantly impaired in patients with frontal lesions [ART: F(2,238) = 18.93; P \&lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than Posterior group and healthy controls, both P \&lt; 0.001; DRT: F(2,387) = 18.491; P \&lt; 0.001; Frontal group worse than healthy controls, P \&lt; 0.01]. Right frontal effects were evident on both tests. Thus, on the ART, right frontal patients were more impaired than left (P \&lt; 0.05). On the DRT, right frontal patients were more impaired than left frontal patients on questions with indeterminate solutions (P \&lt; 0.05) but not on questions with determinate ones. Non-parametric Bayesian stochastic block modelling implicated a right frontal network in ART and DRT performance. Strikingly, we found that this network was also implicated in performance on RAPM.Our study represents the most robust investigation of AR and DR in the focally injured brain. Our findings imply that a right frontal network is critical. The ART and DRT appear to be promising new clinical tests, capable of evaluating reasoning abilities and identifying right frontal lobe dysfunction.},

	abstract = {Maternal perceived prenatal stress (PPS) is a known risk factor for diverse developmental impairments in newborns, but the underlying molecular processes are incompletely understood. Here, we report that maternal PPS altered the birth profiles of blood transfer RNA fragments (tRFs), 16–50 nt long non-random cleavage products of tRNAs, in a sex-dependent manner. Importantly, comparing stressed versus control maternal and umbilical cord blood serum presented alterations that were not limited to individual tRFs, but rather reflected selective changes in particular tRF families grouped by their mitochondrial or nuclear genome origin, parental tRNA coded amino acid, and cleavage type. Specifically, tRF families that show stress- and sex-specific effects, revealed shared length and expression patterns which were strongest in the female newborns. Several of these tRFs carry complementary motifs to particular cholinergic mRNAs, suggesting possible translational regulation similar to microRNAs. Compatible with the cholinergic regulation of stress reactions, those “CholinotRFs” achieved an AUC of 95\% when classifying female newborns according to maternal PPS. Moreover, we found altered catalytic activity of serum acetylcholinesterase, which was particularly elevated in male newborns, marking a second sex-specific effect. Our findings demonstrate an association of tRF families’ patterns with newborns’ sex-specific stress response to PPS and may lead to better diagnosis and therapeutic tools for these and other stressors.},

We focused on differences between stage III remitting–relapsing (EP3R) and stage III non-remitting (EP3NR) patients. Opposing functional connectivity (FC) alterations were observed: EP3NR patients exhibited lower FC compared with controls, while EP3R patients showed higher FC, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms. Whole-brain network modeling revealed lower local stability affecting the ability to regulate the flow of stimuli across the network in stage III patients, particularly in EP3R, which may indicate an adaptation to impaired network conductivity.

	abstract = {Objective
With very few treatments available, post-comatose disorders of consciousness (DoC) pose one of the hardest challenges in modern neurology. Following promising clinical trial results in psychiatry, and a deepening understanding of their brain mechanisms, psychedelics have been suggested as a novel therapeutic drug for DoC patients, given that they increase the entropy or complexity of spontaneous activity in healthy participants. However, no attempts have been so far performed in patients with DoC.
Methods
In this case report, we describe the first-ever administration of psilocybin, a classic psychedelic (i.e., agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor), to a patient in a minimally conscious state plus. We report the behavioural effects and changes in neurophysiology measured with EEG.
Results
We report no increase in overt behavioural repertoire with validated scales, yet new spontaneous behaviour not previously seen, and increased brain complexity, as measured by the Lempel-Ziv complexity index, with changes in the underlying periodic rhythms.
Conclusions
This study contributes to future investigations exploring the use of psychedelics in DoC, enriching the discussion surrounding the role of psychedelics in medicine, and the link between brain complexity and consciousness.
Significance
This is the first-ever report of a classic psychedelic used as a treatment for post-comatose DoC.},

	abstract = {Effective connectivity (EC), which reflects the causal interactions between brain regions, is fundamental to understanding information processing in the brain; however, traditional methods for obtaining EC, which rely on neural responses to stimulation, are often invasive or limited in spatial coverage, making them unsuitable for whole-brain EC mapping in humans. Here, to address this gap, we introduce Neural Perturbational Inference (NPI), a data-driven framework for mapping whole-brain EC. NPI employs an artificial neural network trained to model large-scale neural dynamics, serving as a computational surrogate of the brain. By systematically perturbing all regions in the surrogate brain and analyzing the resulting responses in other regions, NPI maps the directionality, strength and excitatory/inhibitory properties of brain-wide EC. Validation of NPI on generative models with known ground-truth EC demonstrates its superiority over existing methods such as Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling. When applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data across diverse datasets, NPI reveals consistent, structurally supported EC patterns. Furthermore, comparisons with cortico-cortical evoked potential data show a strong resemblance between NPI-inferred EC and real stimulation propagation patterns. By transitioning from correlational to causal understandings of brain functionality, NPI marks a stride in decoding the brain’s functional architecture and facilitating both neuroscience studies and clinical applications.},

We collected micro-phenomenological interviews, psychometric questionnaires, and electroencephalography (EEG) in naturalistic ceremonial settings where 5-MeO-DMT was ingested. Results revealed that the 5-MeO-DMT experience followed a dynamic progression that-only in the most extreme cases-manifested as a complete absence of self-experience and other phenomenal content with preserved awareness. Furthermore, visual imagery, bodily self-disruption, narrative self-disruption, and reduced phenomenal distinctions occurred in a variable fashion. EEG analyses revealed the 5-MeO-DMT experience was characterised by (global) alpha and (posterior) beta power reductions, implying a mode of brain functioning where top-down models are inhibited. Our preliminary phenomenological findings confirm the potential utility of 5-MeO-DMT as a pharmacological model for deconstructed consciousness while noting the limitations of employing retrospective questionnaires for this purpose. Considering the exploratory nature of this study and its limitations inherent to its naturalistic nature, further research employing real-time experience sampling and phenomenologically trained participants in controlled environments could expand our findings to meaningfully inform the potential of this tool for the scientific study of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most demanded screening tools that investigates the effects of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) on human brain. Identification of AD in early stage gives rise to efficient treatment in dementia. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered as a conversion stage. Reducing EEG complexity can be used as a marker to detect AD. The aim of this study is to develop a 3-way diagnostic classification using EEG complexity in the detection of MCI/AD in clinical practice. This study also investigates the effects of different eyes states, i.e. eyes-open, eyes-closed on classification performance.
Methods
EEG recordings from 85 AD, 85 MCI subjects, and 85 Healthy Controls with eyes-open and eyes- closed are analyzed. Permutation Entropy (PE) values are computed from frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions for each EEG epoch. Distribution of PE values are visualized to observe discrimination of MCI/AD with HC. Visual investigations are combined with statistical analysis using ANOVA to determine whether groups are significant or not. Multinomial Logistic Regression model is applied to feature sets in order to classify participants individually.
Results
Distribution of measured PE shows that EEG complexity is lower in AD and higher in HC group. MCI group is observed as an intermediate form due to heterogeneous values. Results from 3-way classification indicate that F1-scores and rates of sensitivity and specificity achieve the highest overall discrimination rates reaching up to 100\% for at TP8 for eyes-closed condition; and C3, C4, T8, O2 electrodes for eyes-open condition. Classification of HC from both patient groups is achieved best. Eyes-open state increases discrimination of MCI and AD.
Conclusions
This nonlinear EEG methodology study contributes to literature with high discrimination rates for identification of AD. PE is recommended as a practical diagnostic neuro-marker for AD studies. Resting state EEG at eyes-open condition can be more advantageous over eyes-closed EEG recordings for diagnosis of AD.},

Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity and related differentially to a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline resting-state EEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG.

Rather than externally constraining behavior, we advocate designing AI with intrinsic morality built into its cognitive architecture and world model.

First, mindfulness enables self-monitoring and recalibration of emergent subgoals. Second, emptiness forestalls dogmatic goal fixation and relaxes rigid priors. Third, non-duality dissolves adversarial self-other boundaries. Fourth, boundless care motivates the universal reduction of suffering. We find that prompting AI to reflect on these principles improves performance on the AILuminate Benchmark using GPT-4o, particularly when combined. We offer detailed implementation strategies for state-of-the-art models, including contemplative architectures, constitutions, and reinforcement of chain-of-thought. For future systems, the active inference framework may offer the self-organizing and dynamic coupling capabilities needed to enact these insights in embodied agents.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.89674.2},
	abstract = {One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioural outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical pyramidal neurons prospectively minimize the local somato-dendritic mismatch error within individual neurons. For motor output neurons, it implies minimizing an instantaneous behavioural error. For deep network neurons, it implies a prospective firing to overcome integration delays and correct for possible output errors right in time. The neuron-specific errors are extracted in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons through a cortical microcircuit that tries to explain away the feedback from the periphery, and correct the trajectory on the fly. Any motor output is in a moving equilibrium with the sensory inputs and the motor feedback during the whole sensory-motor trajectory. Ongoing synaptic plasticity reduces the somato-dendritic mismatch error within each cortical neuron and performs gradient descent on the output cost at any moment in time. The neuronal least-action principle offers an axiomatic framework to derive local neuronal and synaptic dynamics for global real-time computation and learning in the brain and in physical substrates in general.},

They describe the color as blue-green of unprecedented saturation. Further experiments show that subjects perceive Oz colors in image and video form.

	abstract = {Interoception is the ability to perceive and integrate physiological signals from within the body. It is closely related to the autonomic system and is a key component in the generation of affective states and abstract representations of the self (Critchley et al., 2004; Ainley and Tsakiris, 2013). Seth proposes a predictive coding (PC) model of interoception that involves a free-energy based explanation of emotion awareness and selfhood. In this model, emotions, and in turn the sense of self, rely on predictions of the causes of interoceptive signals. Within this framework, the interoceptive system minimizes free-energy, or the discrepancy between predictions and interoceptive signals. Free-energy can be minimized either by updating predictions about the causes of the sensory signals (perceptual updating), or by acting to change autonomic states such that bodily states are more predictable (active inference). The free-energy principle is currently in vogue in neuroscience. We are no longer strangers to the idea that perception is an active iterative process between abstract representations (predictions) and sensory feedback (prediction errors) (Clark, 2013). The basic idea of PC in the cognitive sciences began with the notion of neural energy (Helmholtz, 1860) and it has been present since in the form of theoretical proposals and empirical findings, especially in the visual domain (Lee and Mumford, 2003). Therefore Seth’s proposal that sensory processing involves predictions is nothing new. What is new in Seth’s model is that perception of internal body signals (interoception), paralleling the perception of external signals, relies on top-down predictions of the causes of the sensory input, rather than being a passive, bottom-up process. Is then Seth’s interoceptive inference model an interesting proposal to explain emotion awareness and selfhood? My opinion is yes and that it is worth investigating. However, there are some aspects to consider before designing studies to empirically test Seth’s model. Seth’s model builds on three main assumptions. First, emotions are defined as affective states relying on interactions between top-down interoceptive predictions and bottom-up interoceptive prediction errors. Following the principles of PC, there is a constant attempt to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted and the actual sensory events, either through updating perceptual expectations or through active inference (Friston et al., 2010). As Seth nicely explains, active inference in interoception occurs when predictions are transcribed into reference points that trigger autonomic homeostatic regulation, occurring when the weight of the error is low and attention to errors is attenuated (Gu et al., 2013). Fortunately, advances on biomedical tools allow us to experimentally monitor the body’s physiological signals. Although, some methodological challenges still remain when investigating interoception. This general issue may also impact on PC studies of interoception. However, applying PC to interoception, as proposed in Seth’s model, may allow us to overcome these challenges. The main argument of PC is that all sensory systems are linked by working under identical code schemes (Friston and Kiebel, 2009). Therefore, Seth’s PC model allows us to apply knowledge from visual and other domains to investigate brain and behavioral mechanisms of interoception. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated direct evidence of PC in visual brain areas (Egner et al., 2010, Wyart et al., 2012). Likewise, Seth’s anatomical predictions (i.e. anterior insular cortex -AIC) can be tested by using multivoxel pattern analysis approaches, in combination with orthogonal experimental designs where the stimulus presentation probability is held constant in all conditions (Egner et al., 2010). The second assumption in Seth’s model refers to the AIC as the key structure that generates, compares and updates interoceptive predictions. Empirical evidence has shown that AIC houses a secondary associative area where interoceptive, exteroceptive and motivational signals converge (Seth and Critchley, 2013). An important principle of PC explains that the surprisal generated in one unimodal system can be explained away by inferences in other system via high-order neural areas (Apps and Tsakiris, 2013). Considering the multimodal nature of the AIC, one could suggest that the errors in the interoceptive signal can be explained by exteroceptive inferences (or vice versa) and that the interoceptive generative models are only a part of the way the system explains errors. Whether the AIC exclusively codes the surprisal evoked by interoceptive signals or, alternatively, if the AIC is involved in top-down general predictions directed to a more specialized interoceptive circuit, still remain open questions. The third crucial aspect of Seth’s model is the concept of selfhood. Seth has employed the idea that selfhood is formed by the integration of predictive interoceptive and exteroceptive signals (Tajadura-Jimenez and Tsakiris, 2013). Individual differences in the accuracy of interoceptive awareness influence integration of interoceptive and exteroceptive information, as shown by studies in body illusions (Tsakiris et al., 2011). Individuals with low accuracy show more susceptibility to body illusions, which Seth interprets as lower precision-weighting of interoceptive prediction errors. However, although a free-energy model of self has been proposed (Apps and Tsakiris, 2013), as yet there is no evidence to suggest that self-processing follows the principles of PC. Another crucial factor that may influence interoceptive awareness, and therefore self-awareness, is attention. In PC, attention is considered to be a mechanism that optimizes the precision of prediction errors during hierarchical inference (Feldman and Friston, 2010). For example, studies in vision have demonstrated that attention enhances the neural specificity for expected vs unexpected stimuli in visual cortex (Jiang et al., 2013). Similarly, directing attention towards internal body signals might increase the precision of interoceptive prediction errors and therefore improve interoceptive awareness. An individual’s attention to the body can be significantly enhanced by the practice of Mindfulness (Farb et al., 2012), which also has the effect of enhancing both cortical responses of interoceptive attention and self-reported interoceptive awareness (Mehling et al., 2013). Within Seth’s model this might increase the accuracy of interoceptive inference, emotions, and self-awareness. Therefore, I agree with Seth’s proposal that the brain is a prediction machine that integrates interoceptive and exteroceptive information in a Bayesian way. However, future research is needed to elucidate the internal properties of the interoceptive inference.},

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three target executive functions are moderately correlated with one another, but are clearly separable. Moreover, structural equation modeling suggested that the three functions contribute differentially to performance on complex executive tasks. Specifically, WCST performance was related most strongly to Shifting, TOH to Inhibition, RNG to Inhibition and Updating, and operation span to Updating. Dual task performance was not related to any of the three target functions. These results suggest that it is important to recognize both the unity and diversity of executive functions and that latent variable analysis is a useful approach to studying the organization and roles of executive functions.},

Amygdala neurons frequently signaled reward probability in an abstract, stimulus-independent code that generalized across cue formats. While some probability-coding neurons were insensitive to magnitude information, signaling ‘pure’ probability rather than value, many neurons showed biphasic responses that signaled probability and magnitude in a dynamic (temporally-patterned) and flexible (reversible) value code. Specific amygdala neurons integrated these reward attributes into risk signals that quantified the variance of expected rewards, distinct from value. Population codes were accurate, mutually transferable between value components, and expressed differently across amygdala nuclei.

However, evidence is limited by a disease-specific focus and no systematic examination of sex differences or the role of pre-existing mental disorders.MethodsWe conducted a cohort study using data on social disconnectedness (loneliness, social isolation, low social support and a composite measure) from the 2013 and 2017 Danish National Health Survey linked with register data on 11 broad categories of medical conditions through 2021. Poisson regression was applied to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs), incidence rate differences (IRDs), and explore sex differences and interaction with pre-existing mental disorders.ResultsAmong 162,497 survey participants, 7.6\%, 3.5\% and 14.8\% were classified as lonely, socially isolated and with low social support, respectively. Individuals who were lonely and with low social support had a higher incidence rate in all 11 categories of medical conditions (interquartile range [IQR] of IRRs, respectively 1.26–1.49 and 1.10–1.14), whereas this was the case in nine categories among individuals who were socially isolated (IQR of IRRs, 1.01–1.31). Applying the composite measure, the highest IRR was 2.63 for a mental disorder (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.38–2.91), corresponding to an IRD of 54 (95\% CI, 47–61) cases per 10,000 person-years. We found sex and age differences in some relative and absolute estimates, but no substantial deviations from additive interaction with pre-existing mental disorders.ConclusionsThis study advances our knowledge of the risk of medical conditions faced by individuals who are socially disconnected. In addition to the existing evidence, we found higher incidence rates for a broad range of medical condition categories. Contrary to previous evidence, our findings suggest that loneliness is a stronger determinant for subsequent medical conditions than social isolation and low social support.A preregistered analysis plan and statistical code are available at Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/pycrq).},

Using in vivo longitudinal imaging with single-synapse resolution in the mouse motor cortex during motor learning, we found that apical and basal dendrites of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons showed distinct activity-dependent synaptic plasticity rules. The strengthening of apical and of basal synapses is predicted by local coactivity with nearby synapses and activity coincident with postsynaptic action potentials, respectively. Blocking postsynaptic spiking diminished basal synaptic potentiation without affecting apical plasticity.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia is characterized by significant molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity, which confounds its mechanistic understanding, diagnosis, and effective treatment. In this study, we harness the most comprehensive dataset of paired ante-mortem blood omics, clinical, psychological, and post-mortem brain multi-omics data and neuroimaging to extensively characterize and translate the molecular taxonomy of AD dementia to living individuals. First, utilizing a comprehensive integration of eight complementary molecular layers from brain multi-omics data (N = 1,189), we identified three distinct molecular AD dementia subtypes exhibiting strong associations with cognitive decline, sex, psychological traits, brain morphology, and characterized by specific cellular and molecular drivers involving immune, vascular, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Next, in a significant translational effort, we developed predictive models to convert these advanced brain-derived molecular profiles (AD dementia pseudotimes and subtypes) into blood-, MRI- and psychological traits-based markers. The translation results underscore both the promise of these models and the opportunities for further enhancement. Our findings enhance the understanding of AD heterogeneity, underscore the value of multi-scale molecular approaches for elucidating causal mechanisms, and lay the groundwork for the development of novel therapies in living persons that target multi-level brain molecular subtypes of AD dementia.},

Yet experiments demonstrate that some neurons are capable of complex computations that require interactions between inputs. Here we show, across multiple brain regions and species, that simple computations (without interactions between inputs) explain most of the variability in neuronal activity. Neurons are quantitatively described by models that capture the measured dependence on each input individually, but assume nothing about combinations of inputs. These minimal models, which are equivalent to binary artificial neurons, predict complex higher-order dependencies and recover known features of synaptic connectivity. The inferred computations are low-dimensional, indicating a highly redundant neural code that is necessary for error correction. These results suggest that, despite intricate biophysical details, most neurons perform simple computations typically reserved for artificial models.},

We define a formal counterpart of physical and intentional stances within computational theory: a description of a system as either a device, or an agent, with the key difference being that `devices' are directly described in terms of an input-output mapping, while `agents' are described in terms of the function they optimise. Bayes' rule can then be applied to calculate the subjective probability of a system being a device or an agent, based only on its behaviour. We illustrate this using the trajectories of an object in a toy grid-world domain.},

This effect size grew over the course of the experiment (∼10 minutes), consistent with learning effects. A biologically plausible recurrent neural network model showed that learning and oddball representation are an emergent property of flexible tone discrimination. Last, when we played language stimuli, single units and ensembles carried information about the semantic and grammatical features of natural speech, even predicting semantic information about upcoming words. Together these results indicate that in the hippocampus, which is anatomically and functionally distant from primary sensory cortices,7 complex processing of sensory stimuli occurs even in the unconscious state.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks depend upon biological entities for their preservation. Such entities, from human cognition to evolution, must first encode and then replicate those networks under marked resource constraints. Networks that survive are those that are amenable to constrained encoding—or, in other words, are compressible. But how compressible is a network? And what features make one network more compressible than another? Here, we answer these questions by modeling networks as information sources before compressing them using rate-distortion theory. Each network yields a unique rate-distortion curve, which specifies the minimal amount of information that remains at a given scale of description. A natural definition then emerges for the compressibility of a network: the amount of information that can be removed via compression, averaged across all scales. Analyzing an array of real and model networks, we demonstrate that compressibility increases with two common network properties: transitivity (or clustering) and degree heterogeneity. These results indicate that hierarchical organization—which is characterized by modular structure and heterogeneous degrees—facilitates compression in complex networks. Generally, our framework sheds light on the interplay between a network’s structure and its capacity to be compressed, enabling investigations into the role of compression in shaping real-world networks.},

As an electrophysiological index of processing that responds to differences in incoming consecutive stimuli, the MMN can be elicited through, for example, the presentation of two different categories of sounds in an oddball paradigm where sounds from the “standard” category occur frequently and sounds from the “deviant” category occur rarely. The specificity of what can elicit the MMN is yet to be fully defined. Here we test whether the MMN can be generated by an abstract linguistic contrast with no reliable acoustic cue. Previous studies have shown that the way in which an acoustic cue is used to elicit MMN is influenced by linguistic knowledge, but have not shown that a nonacoustic, abstract linguistic contrast can itself elicit MMN. In this study, we test the strongest interpretation of the claim that the MMN can be generated through a purely linguistic contrast by contrasting tenses in ablauting irregular English verbs (where there is no reliable acoustic cue for tense). We find that this contrast elicits a negativity, as do other linguistic contrasts previously shown to elicit MMN (a contrast between phonologically voiced and phonologically voiceless segments and a purely acoustic contrast between aspirated and unaspirated segments). The findings provide evidence that the MMN is indeed sensitive to purely abstract linguistic categories.},

The study of the functional connectome, which maps the functional connections between different brain regions, has provided valuable insights through various advanced analysis techniques developed over the years. Similarly, neural networks, inspired by the brain's architecture, have achieved notable success in diverse applications but are often noted for their lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that bridges neural networks and human brain functions by leveraging brain-inspired techniques. Our approach, grounded in the insights from the functional connectome, offers scalable ways to characterize topology of large neural networks using stable statistical and machine learning techniques. Our empirical analysis demonstrates its capability to enhance the interpretability of neural networks, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.},

Echo State Network (ESN) is simple type of RNNs and has emerged in the last decade as an alternative to gradient descent training based RNNs. ESN, with a strong theoretical ground, is practical, conceptually simple, easy to implement. It avoids non-converging and computationally expensive in the gradient descent methods. Since ESN was put forward in 2002, abundant existing works have promoted the progress of ESN, and the recently introduced Deep ESN model opened the way to uniting the merits of deep learning and ESNs. Besides, the combinations of ESNs with other machine learning models have also overperformed baselines in some applications. However, the apparent simplicity of ESNs can sometimes be deceptive and successfully applying ESNs needs some experience. Thus, in this paper, we categorize the ESN-based methods to basic ESNs, DeepESNs and combinations, then analyze them from the perspective of theoretical studies, network designs and specific applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of ESNs by summarizing the open questions and proposing possible future works.},

	abstract = {Near-death experiences (NDEs) are episodes of disconnected consciousness that typically occur in situations that involve an actual or potential physical threat or are perceived as such, and the experiences are characterized by a rich content with prototypical mystical features. Several explanatory theories for NDEs have been proposed, ranging from psychological or neurophysiological to evolutionary models. However, these concepts were often formulated independently, and, owing to the fragmented nature of research in this domain, integration of these ideas has been limited. Lines of empirical evidence from different areas of neuroscience, including non-human studies, studies investigating psychedelic-induced mystical experiences\&nbsp;in humans, and research on the dying brain, are now converging to provide a comprehensive explanation for NDEs. In this Review, we discuss processes that might underlie the rich conscious experience in NDEs, mostly focusing on prototypical examples and addressing both the potential psychological mechanisms and neurophysiological changes, including cellular and electrophysiological brain network modifications and alterations in neurotransmitter release. On the basis of this discussion, we propose a model for NDEs that encompasses a cascade of concomitant psychological and neurophysiological processes within an evolutionary framework. We also consider how NDE research can inform the debate on the emergence of consciousness in near-death conditions that arise before brain death. Near-death experiences (NDEs) are episodes of disconnected consciousness that typically occur in actual or perceived life-threatening situations. This Review discusses the mechanisms that might underlie the rich conscious experience in NDEs and proposes a model that encompasses a cascade of concomitant psychological and neurophysiological processes within an evolutionary framework.},

Biophysical models are governed by biologically meaningful parameters, many of which can be experimentally measured.

Previous optimization methods – such as exhaustive search, gradient descent, evolutionary strategies and Bayesian optimization – require repeated, computationally expensive numerical integration of biophysical differential equations, limiting scalability to population-level datasets. Here, we introduce DELSSOME (DEep Learning for Surrogate Statistics Optimization in MEan field modeling), a framework that bypasses numerical integration by directly predicting whether model parameters produce realistic brain dynamics. When applied to the widely used feedback inhibition control (FIC) mean field model, DELSSOME achieves a 2000× speedup over Euler integration. By embedding DELSSOME within an evolutionary optimization strategy, trained models generalize to new datasets without additional tuning, enabling a 50× speedup in FIC model estimation while preserving neurobiological insights. The massive acceleration facilitates large-scale mechanistic modeling in population-level neuroscience, unlocking new opportunities for understanding brain function.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an established treatment for refractory major depressive disorder (MDD), but treatment outcomes vary substantially from person to person. Recent evidence suggests that incorporating neuroimaging-based targeting may help improve clinical outcomes. Here, we report the initial clinical outcomes of our open-label fMRI-personalized treatment protocol from the Queensland Neurostimulation Centre (QNC).
Methods:
This open-label, nonrandomized study was conducted between November 2021 and September 2024. Participants were a referred sample aged between 19 and 84, meeting the criteria for treatment-resistant MDD (N=61). They received 20 or 30-weekday sessions of DLPFC rTMS. The stimulation site was personalized using each individual’s fMRI brain connectivity data.
Results:
The primary outcome was change in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). MADRS was lower post-treatment (d=1.78, p\&lt;.001), with 52\% and 33\% response and remission rates observed. Likewise, anxiety scores (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) were lower post-treatment (d=1.27, p\&lt;.001), with 46\% and 28\% response and remission rates observed. The treatment was most effective in patients who qualified for randomized controlled trials (RCTs; N=19, MADRS response=74\%, remission=53\%) and least effective in patients with bipolar or neurological disorders (N=8, MADRS response=37\%, remission=25\%). Neurophysiologically, functional brain connectivity in the personalized DLPFC-SGC pathway was less anti-correlated post-treatment (d=0.63, p\&lt;.001).
Conclusion:
Our findings provide new clinical and neurophysiological evidence supporting the high effectiveness of fMRI-connectivity-guided personalized rTMS for MDD, especially in individuals without complex comorbidities. The results encourage future RCTs to assess the superiority of personalized targeting over standard TMS.},

Psilocybin shows early promise for treating depression and anxiety, but its potential in PD is unknown, as safety concerns have excluded people with neurodegenerative disease from previous trials. In this open-label pilot (NCT04932434), we examined the feasibility of psilocybin therapy among people with mild to moderate stage PD plus depression and/or anxiety. 12 participants (mean age 63.2 ± 8.2 years, 5 women) received psilocybin (one 10 mg followed by one 25 mg dose) with psychotherapy. There were no serious adverse events, no medical interventions required to manage effects of psilocybin, and no exacerbation of psychosis. Ten participants experienced treatment-emergent adverse events; the most frequent were anxiety, nausea, and increased blood pressure. We observed no worsening of PD symptomology measured by the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).

These models combine connectivity matrices, or connectomes, with local node dynamics, noise, and, eventually, transmission delays. Multiple choices for the local dynamics have been proposed. Among them, nonlinear oscillators corresponding to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation have been used to link brain connectivity and collective phase and amplitude dynamics in different brain states. Here, we studied the linear fluctuations of this model to estimate its stationary statistics, i.e., the instantaneous and lagged covariances and the power spectral densities. This linear approximation—that holds in the case of heterogeneous parameters and time-delays—allows analytical estimation of the statistics and it can be used for fast parameter explorations to study changes in brain state, changes in brain activity due to alterations in structural connectivity, and modulations of parameter due to non-equilibrium dynamics.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD {\textless} HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.},

Although there is no cure for AD, early diagnosis and an accurate characterization of the disease progression can improve the quality of life of AD patients and their caregivers. Currently, AD diagnosis is carried out using standardized mental status examinations, which are commonly assisted by expensive neuroimaging scans and invasive laboratory tests, thus rendering the diagnosis time consuming and costly. Notwithstanding, over the last decade, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a noninvasive alternative technique for the study of AD, competing with more expensive neuroimaging tools, such as MRI and PET. This paper reports on the results of a systematic review on the utilization of resting-state EEG signals for AD diagnosis and progression assessment. Recent journal articles obtained from four major bibliographic databases were analyzed. A total of 112 journal articles published from January 2010 to February 2018 were meticulously reviewed, and relevant aspects of these papers were compared across articles to provide a general overview of the research on this noninvasive AD diagnosis technique. Finally, recommendations for future studies with resting-state EEG were presented to improve and facilitate the knowledge transfer among research groups.},

Although the safety and preliminary clinical efficacy of TPS short pulses have been supported by neuropsychological scores in treated AD patients, its fundamental mechanisms are uncharted. METHODS Herein, we used a multi-modal preclinical imaging platform combining real-time volumetric optoacoustic tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and ex vivo immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze structural and hemodynamic effects induced by TPS. Cohorts of healthy and AD transgenic mice were imaged during and after TPS exposure at various per-pulse energy levels. RESULTS TPS enhanced the microvascular network, whereas the blood–brain barrier remained intact following the procedure. Notably, higher pulse energies were necessary to induce hemodynamic changes in AD mice, arguably due to their impacted vessels. DISCUSSION These findings shed light on cerebrovascular dynamics induced by TPS treatment, and hence are expected to assist improving safety and therapeutic outcomes. Highlights ·Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) facilitates transcranial wave propagation using short pulses to avoid tissue heating. ·Preclinical multi-modal imaging combines real-time volumetric optoacoustic (OA) tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), and ex vivo immunofluorescence to comprehensively analyze structural and hemodynamic effects induced by TPS. ·Blood volume enhancement in microvascular networks was reproducibly observed with real-time OA imaging during TPS stimulation. ·CE-MRI and gross pathology further confirmed that the brain architecture was maintained intact without blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening after TPS exposure, thus validating the safety of the procedure. ·Higher pulse energies were necessary to induce hemodynamic changes in AD compared to wild-type animals, arguably due to their pathological vessels.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The human brain is characterized by interacting large-scale functional networks fueled by glucose metabolism. Since former studies could not sufficiently clarify how these functional connections shape glucose metabolism, we aimed to provide a neurophysiologically-based approach.
Methods
51 healthy volunteers underwent simultaneous PET/MRI to obtain BOLD functional connectivity and [18F]FDG glucose metabolism. These multimodal imaging proxies of fMRI and PET were combined in a whole-brain extension of metabolic connectivity mapping. Specifically, functional connectivity of all brain regions were used as input to explain glucose metabolism of a given target region. This enabled the modeling of postsynaptic energy demands by incoming signals from distinct brain regions.
Results
Functional connectivity input explained a substantial part of metabolic demands but with pronounced regional variations (34 - 76\%). During cognitive task performance this multimodal association revealed a shift to higher network integration compared to resting state. In healthy aging, a dedifferentiation (decreased segregated/modular structure of the brain) of brain networks during rest was observed. Furthermore, by including data from mRNA maps, [11C]UCB-J synaptic density and aerobic glycolysis (oxygen-to-glucose index from PET data), we show that whole-brain functional input reflects non-oxidative, on-demand metabolism of synaptic signaling. The metabolically-derived directionality of functional inputs further marked them as top-down predictions. In addition, the approach uncovered formerly hidden networks with superior efficiency through metabolically informed network partitioning.
Conclusions
Applying multimodal imaging, we decipher a crucial part of the metabolic and neurophysiological basis of functional connections in the brain as interregional on-demand synaptic signaling fueled by anaerobic metabolism. The observed task- and age-related effects indicate promising future applications to characterize human brain function and clinical alterations.},

Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of "intelligence", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.},

Here, we contribute to this framework by examining gradients of functional connectivity as a low dimensional spatial representation of functional variation in the brain and demonstrating their computational implications for predictive processing. Specifically, we investigated functional connectivity gradients in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus using resting-state functional MRI data collected from large samples of healthy young adults. We then evaluated the degree to which these structures share common principles of functional organization by assessing the correspondence of their gradients. We show that the organizing principles of these structures primarily follow two functional gradients consistent with the existing hierarchical accounts of predictive processing: A model-error gradient that describes the flow of prediction and prediction error signals, and a model-precision gradient that differentiates regions involved in the representation and attentional modulation of such signals in the cerebral cortex. Using these gradients, we also demonstrated triangulation of functional connectivity involving distinct subregions of the three structures, which allows characterization of distinct ways in which these structures functionally interact with each other, possibly subserving unique and complementary aspects of predictive processing. These findings support the viability of computational hypotheses about the functional relationships between the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the hippocampus that may be instrumental for understanding the brain’s dynamics within its large-scale predictive architecture.},

Most WM models contain pre-formed content-specific structures of neurons for loading specific items into memory, which lacks of flexibility of natural WM. On the other hand, long-term synaptic plasticity such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) seems to be the best mechanism to form content depended functional and structural neural ensembles without preliminary tuning. In this work, we develop a flexible model of WM based on synaptic theory considering two types of plasticity: short-term plasticity and STDP without pre-formed neuronal clusters. The numerical simulations show the formation of such populations as an STDP-driven response to an external stimuli. The model is implemented in a recurrent network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons in excitable mode. We demonstrate formation of neuronal clusters encoding items in the WM model due to STDP and hold and reactivated by short-term plasticity mechanisms. The relevance of the proposed WM model is confirmed by the similarity of the WM capacity dependence on synaptic facilitation and depression time constants with previous results obtained earlier for the model with only short-term plasticity. Increasing the STDP learning rate parameter resulted in increased WM capacity on average.},

	abstract = {Global implementation of blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) would be facilitated by easily scalable, cost-effective and accurate tests. In the present study, we evaluated plasma phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) using predefined biomarker cutoffs. The study included 1,767 participants with cognitive symptoms from 4 independent secondary care cohorts in Malmö (Sweden, n = 337), Gothenburg (Sweden, n = 165), Barcelona (Spain, n = 487) and Brescia (Italy, n = 230), and a primary care cohort in Sweden (n = 548). Plasma p-tau217 was primarily measured using the fully automated, commercially available, Lumipulse immunoassay. The primary outcome was AD pathology defined as abnormal cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42:p-tau181. Plasma p-tau217 detected AD pathology with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.93–0.96. In secondary care, the accuracies were 89–91\%, the positive predictive values 89–95\% and the negative predictive values 77–90\%. In primary care, the accuracy was 85\%, the positive predictive values 82\% and the negative predictive values 88\%. Accuracy was lower in participants aged ≥80 years (83\%), but was unaffected by chronic kidney disease, diabetes, sex, APOE genotype or cognitive stage. Using a two-cutoff approach, accuracies increased to 92–94\% in secondary and primary care, excluding 12–17\% with intermediate results. Using the plasma p-tau217:Aβ42 ratio did not improve accuracy but reduced intermediate test results (≤10\%). Compared with a high-performing mass-spectrometry-based assay for percentage p-tau217, accuracies were comparable in secondary care. However, percentage p-tau217 had higher accuracy in primary care and was unaffected by age. In conclusion, this fully automated p-tau217 test demonstrates high accuracy for identifying AD pathology. A two-cutoff approach might be necessary to optimize performance across diverse settings and subpopulations.},

We simultaneously recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the thalamic nuclei and prefrontal cortex (PFC), while patients with implanted electrodes performed a visual consciousness task. Compared with the ventral nuclei and PFC, the intralaminar and medial nuclei presented earlier and stronger consciousness-related activity. Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception. The intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei thus play a gate role to drive the activity of the PFC during the emergence of conscious perception.},

With constant stimulus intensity, the hemodynamic response fluctuated; these fluctuations were only loosely related to action potential frequency but tightly correlated to the power of LFP oscillations in the gamma range.

	abstract = {Mental health disorders and cognitive decline are pressing global concerns, increasing the demand for non-pharmacological interventions targeting emotional dysregulation, memory deficits, and neural dysfunction. This review systematically examines three promising methodologies—music therapy, brainwave entrainment (binaural beats, isochronic tones, multisensory stimulation), and their integration into a unified therapeutic paradigm. Emerging evidence indicates that music therapy modulates affect, reduces stress, and enhances cognition by engaging limbic, prefrontal, and reward circuits. Brainwave entrainment, particularly within the gamma frequency range (30–100 Hz), facilitates neural oscillatory patterns linked to relaxation, concentration, and memory, with 40 Hz showing promise for cognitive enhancement, albeit with individual variability. Synchronized multisensory stimulation, combining auditory and visual inputs at gamma frequencies, has demonstrated potential in enhancing memory and supporting neural integrity, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. However, challenges such as patient response variability, lack of standardization, and scalability hinder widespread implementation. Recent research suggests that a synergistic application of these modalities may optimize therapeutic outcomes by leveraging complementary mechanisms. To actualize this, AI-driven biofeedback, enabling real-time physiological assessment and individualized adjustments—such as tailoring musical complexity, entrainment frequencies, and multisensory components—emerges as a promising solution. This adaptive model enhances treatment accessibility and consistency while maximizing long-term efficacy. Although in early stages, preliminary evidence highlights its transformative potential in reshaping non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies. Advancing this field requires interdisciplinary research, rigorous evaluation, and ethical data stewardship to develop innovative, patient-centered solutions for mental health and cognitive rehabilitation.},

The spiking characteristics are species specific: a spike duration varies from 1 to 21 h and an amplitude from 0.03 to 2.1 mV. We found that spikes are often clustered into trains. Assuming that spikes of electrical activity are used by fungi to communicate and process information in mycelium networks, we group spikes into words and provide a linguistic and information complexity analysis of the fungal spiking activity. We demonstrate that distributions of fungal word lengths match that of human languages. We also construct algorithmic and Liz-Zempel complexity hierarchies of fungal sentences and show that species S. commune generate the most complex sentences.},

Here we report that individuals whose mothers conceived during cold seasons exhibit higher BAT activity, adaptive thermogenesis, increased daily total energy expenditure and lower body mass index and visceral fat accumulation. Structural equation modelling indicated that conception during the cold season protects against age-associated increase in body mass index through BAT activation in offspring. Meteorological analysis revealed that lower outdoor temperatures and greater fluctuations in daily temperatures during the fertilization period are key determinants of BAT activity. These findings suggest that BAT metabolic fate and susceptibility of metabolic diseases are preprogrammed by the epigenetic inheritance of cold exposure before the fertilization in humans.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique with potential for counteracting disrupted brain network activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to improve cognition. However, the results of tDCS studies in AD have been variable due to different methodological choices such as electrode placement. To address this, a virtual brain network model of AD was used to explore tDCS optimization. We compared a large, representative set of virtual tDCS intervention setups, to identify the theoretically optimized tDCS electrode positions for restoring functional network features disrupted in AD. We simulated 20 tDCS setups using a computational dynamic network model of 78 neural masses coupled according to human structural topology. AD network damage was simulated using an activity-dependent degeneration algorithm. Current flow modeling was used to estimate tDCS-targeted cortical regions for different electrode positions, and excitability of the pyramidal neurons of the corresponding neural masses was modulated to simulate tDCS. Outcome measures were relative power spectral density (alpha bands, 8-10 Hz and 10-13 Hz), total spectral power, posterior alpha peak frequency, and connectivity measures phase lag index (PLI) and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC). Virtual tDCS performance varied, with optimized strategies improving all outcome measures, while others caused further deterioration. The best performing setup involved right parietal anodal stimulation, with a contralateral supraorbital cathode. A clear correlation between the network role of stimulated regions and tDCS success was not observed. This modeling-informed approach can guide and perhaps accelerate tDCS therapy development and enhance our understanding of tDCS effects. Follow-up studies will compare the general predictions to personalized virtual models and validate them with tDCS-magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a clinical AD patient cohort.},

We use curve-fitting with a combination of a power loss and Gaussian function to model the averaged resting-state spectra of each EEG channel extracting six parameters. We assessed the performance of our model and tested the extracted parameters for group differentiation. We performed regression analysis in a multivariate analysis of covariance with group, age, gender, and number of epochs as predictors and further explored the topographical group differences with pair-wise contrasts. Significant topographical differences between the groups were found in several of the extracted features. Both AD and VaD groups showed increased delta power when compared to NC, whereas the AD patients showed a decrease in alpha power for occipital and temporal regions when compared with NC. The VaD patients had higher alpha power than NC and AD. The AD and VaD groups showed slowing of the alpha rhythm. Variability of the alpha frequency was wider for both AD and VaD groups. There was a general decrease in beta power for both AD and VaD. The proposed model is useful to parameterize spectra, which allowed extracting relevant clinical EEG key features that move toward simple and interpretable diagnostic criteria.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Neurophysiological patterns may distinguish which youth are at risk for the well-documented increase in internalizing symptoms during adolescence. Adolescents with internalizing problems exhibit altered resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) of brain regions involved in socio-affective processing. Whether connectivity-based biotypes differentiate adolescents’ levels of internalizing problems remains unknown.

METHOD:
Sixty-eight adolescents (37 females) reported on their internalizing problems at ages 14, 16, and 18 years. A resting state functional neuroimaging scan was collected at age 16. Time-series data of 15 internalizing-relevant brain regions were entered into the Subgroup-Group Iterative Multi Model Estimation program to identify subgroups based on RSFC maps. Associations between internalizing problems and connectivity-based biotypes were tested with regression analyses.

RESULTS:
Two connectivity-based biotypes were found: a Diffusely-connected biotype (N = 46), with long-range fronto-parietal paths, and a Hyper-connected biotype (N = 22), with paths between subcortical and medial frontal areas (e.g., affective and default-mode network regions). Higher levels of past (age 14) internalizing problems predicted a greater likelihood of belonging to the Hyper-connected biotype at age 16. The Hyper-connected biotype showed higher levels of concurrent problems (age 16) and future (age 18) internalizing problems.

CONCLUSIONS:
Differential patterns of RSFC among socio-affective brain regions were predicted by earlier internalizing problems and predicted future internalizing problems in adolescence. Measuring connectivity-based biotypes in adolescence may offer insight into which youth face elevated risk for internalizing disorders during this critical developmental period.},

In this investigation, 156 volunteers participated, comprising 46 adolescents with MDD (adolescent-onset group), 35 adults with MDD (adult-onset group), 19 healthy adolescents, and 56 healthy adults. Resting-state functional MRI scans were undergone by all participants. Large-scale network analyses were applied. Subsequently, a 2 × 2 ANOVA was employed to analyze the main effects of diagnosis, age, and their interaction effect on functional connectivity (FC). Furthermore, regression analysis was employed to scrutinize the association between anomalous FC and HAMD sub-scores. Increased FC in visual network (VN), limbic network (LN), VN-dorsal attention network (DAN), VN-LN, and LN-Default Mode (DMN) was found in both adolescent-onset and adult-onset MDD; however, the increased FC in DAN and LN were only found in adult-onset MDD and the decreased FC in DAN was only found in adolescent-onset MDD. Additionally, the relationship between HAMD factor 1 anxiety somatization and altered FC of DAN, VN, and VN-DAN was moderated by AOO. In conclusion, shared and distinctive large-scale network alterations in adolescent-onset and adult-onset MDD patients were suggested by our findings, providing valuable contributions towards refining clinical subtyping and treatment approaches for MDD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a transition period characterized by heightened emotional reactivity, which for some sets the stage for emerging depressive symptoms. Prior studies suggest that adolescent depression is associated with deviant cortical and subcortical brain structure. Longitudinal studies are, however, currently scarce, but critical to detect which adolescents are at risk for developing depressive symptoms.
METHODS: In this longitudinal study, a community sample of 205 participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three biennial waves (522 scans) spanning 5 years across ages 8-25 years. Depressive symptomatology was assessed using self-report at the third time point. Mixed models were used to examine the relations between structural brain development, specifically regional change in cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volumes (hippocampus and amygdala), and depressive symptoms.
RESULTS: Accelerated frontal lobe cortical thinning was observed in adolescents who developed depressive symptoms at the third time point. This effect remained after controlling for parent-reported affective problems at the first time point. Moreover, the effect was driven by specific lateral orbitofrontal and precentral regions. In addition, differential developmental trajectories of parietal cortical thickness and surface area in several regions were found for participants reporting higher depressive symptomatology, but these results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. Volumes or developmental volume changes in hippocampus or amygdala were not related to depressive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that emerging depression is associated with cortical thinning in frontal regions within individuals. These findings move beyond detecting cross-sectional correlations and set the stage for early detection, which may inform future intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The age-related heterogeneity in major depressive disorder (MDD) has received significant attention. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such heterogeneity still need further investigation. This study aimed to explore the common and distinct functional brain abnormalities across different age groups of MDD patients from a large-sample, multicenter analysis.
METHODS: The analyzed sample consisted of a total of 1238 individuals including 617 MDD patients (108 adolescents, 12-17 years old; 411 early-middle adults, 18-54 years old; and 98 late adults, {\textgreater} = 55 years old) and 621 demographically matched healthy controls (60 adolescents, 449 early-middle adults, and 112 late adults). MDD-related abnormalities in brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns were investigated in each age group separately and using the whole pooled sample, respectively.
RESULTS: We found shared FC reductions among the sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks across all three age groups of MDD patients. Furthermore, adolescent patients uniquely exhibited increased sensorimotor-subcortical FC; early-middle adult patients uniquely exhibited decreased visual-subcortical FC; and late adult patients uniquely exhibited wide FC reductions within the subcortical, default-mode, cingulo-opercular, and attention networks. Analysis of covariance models using the whole pooled sample further revealed: (1) significant main effects of age group on FCs within most brain networks, suggesting that they are decreased with aging; and (2) a significant age group × MDD diagnosis interaction on FC within the default-mode network, which may be reflective of an accelerated aging-related decline in default-mode FCs.
CONCLUSIONS: To summarize, these findings may deepen our understanding of the age-related biological and clinical heterogeneity in MDD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging research suggests that major depressive disorder (MDD) in both adults and adolescents is marked by aberrant connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) during resting state. However, emotional dysregulation is also a key feature of MDD. No studies to date have examined emotion-related DMN pathology in adolescent depression. Comprehensively understanding the dynamics of DMN connectivity across brain states in individuals with depression with short disease histories could provide insight into the etiology of MDD.
METHODS: We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging data during an emotion identification task and during resting state from 26 medication-free adolescents (13-17 years old) with MDD and 37 well-matched healthy control subjects. We examined between-group differences in blood oxygenation level-dependent task responses and emotion-dependent and resting-state functional connectivity of the two primary nodes of the DMN: medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Additionally, we examined between-group differences in DMN functional connectivity and its relationship to depression severity and onset.
RESULTS: Relative to healthy control subjects, unmedicated adolescents with MDD demonstrated reduced medial prefrontal cortex and PCC emotion-related deactivation and greater medial prefrontal cortex and PCC emotion-dependent functional connectivity with precuneus, cingulate gyrus, and striatum/subcallosal cingulate gyrus. The PCC-subcallosal cingulate connectivity remained inflexibly elevated in the subjects with MDD versus healthy control subjects during resting state. Stronger PCC emotion-dependent functional connectivity was associated with greater depression severity and an earlier age of depression onset.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent depression is associated with inflexibly elevated DMN connections. Given more recent evidence of DMN maturation throughout adolescence, our findings suggest that early-onset depression adversely affects normal development of functional brain networks.},

Depression is the leading global cause of disability and often begins in adolescence. The genetic architecture and treatment response profiles for adults and adolescents differ even though identical criteria are used to diagnose depression across different age groups. There is no clear consensus on how these groups differ in their symptom profiles.
Methods
Using data from a two-generation family study, we compared the presentation of DSM-IV depressive symptoms in adolescents and adults with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder). We also compared DSM-IV depressive symptom counts using latent class analysis.
Results
Vegetative symptoms (appetite and weight change, loss of energy and insomnia) were more common in adolescent MDD than adult MDD. Anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration problems were more common in adults with MDD. When using latent class analysis to look at depressive symptoms, a vegetative symptom profile was also seen in adolescent depression only.
Limitations
Adults and adolescents were recruited in different ways. Adolescent cases were more likely to be first-onset while adult cases were recurrences. It was not possible to examine how recurrence affected adolescent depression symptom profiles.
Conclusion
Differences in how depression presents in adolescents and adults may be consistent with different pathophysiological mechanisms. For adolescents, we found that vegetative/physical disturbances were common (loss of energy, changes in weight, appetite and sleep changes). For adults, anhedonia/loss of interest and concentration difficulties were more common.},

	abstract = {Background
Although dysfunction of amygdala-related circuits is centrally implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), little is known about how this dysfunction differs between adult and adolescent MDD patients.

Methods
Voxel-wise meta-analyses of abnormal amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) were conducted in adult and adolescent groups separately, followed by a quantitative meta-analytic comparison of the two groups.

Findings
Nineteen studies that included 665 MDD patients (392 adults and 273 adolescents) and 546 controls (341 adults and 205 adolescents) were identified in the current study. Adult-specific abnormal amygdala rsFC in MDD patients compared to that in controls was located mainly within the affective network, including increased connectivity with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus and bilateral ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex and decreased connectivity with the bilateral insula and the left caudate. Adolescent MDD patients specifically demonstrated decreased amygdala rsFC within the cognitive control network encompassing the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and imbalanced amygdala rsFC within the default mode network, which was manifested as hyperconnectivity in the right precuneus and hypoconnectivity in the right inferior temporal gyrus. Additionally, direct comparison between the two groups showed that adult patients had strengthened amygdala rsFC with the right hippocampus/parahippocampus as well as the right inferior temporal gyrus and weakened amygdala rsFC with the bilateral insula compared to that in adolescent patients.

Interpretation
Distinct impairments of amygdala-centered rsFC in adult and adolescent patients were related to different network dysfunctions in MDD. Adult-specific amygdala rsFC dysfunction within the affective network presumably reflects emotional dysregulation in MDD, whereas adolescent-specific amygdala rsFC abnormalities in networks involved in cognitive control might reflect the neural basis of affective cognition deficiency that is characteristic of adolescent MDD.

Studies have implicated neural activation in cortical midline brain structures in self-related information processing, yet it remains unclear how this activation may underlie subjective self-concept and links to depression in adolescence. We examined these associations by assessing neural activity during negative vs. positive self-referential processing in 39 11-to-13-year-old girls. During a functional neuroimaging task, girls reported on their perceptions of self-concept by rating how true they believed positive and negative personality traits were about them. Girls reported on depressive symptoms at the scan and 6 months later. Activation in the dorsomedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortexes (dMPFC; VLPFC), and visual association area was significantly associated with subjective self-concept and/or depressive symptoms at the scan or 6 months later. Exploratory models showed higher activation in the dMPFC to Self-negative {\textgreater} Self-positive was indirectly associated with concurrent depressive symptoms through more negative self-concept. Higher activation in the visual association area to Self-positive {\textgreater} Self-negative was associated with lower depressive symptoms at follow-up through more positive self-concept.

Adolescence is also a risk period for the new onset of anxiety and depressive disorders, psychopathologies which have long been associated with disruptions in regulation of positive and negative emotions. This paper reviews the current understanding of the role of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescent anxiety and depression, describing findings from self-report, behavioral, peripheral psychophysiological, and neural measures. Self-report studies robustly identified associations between emotion dysregulation and adolescent anxiety and depression. Findings from behavioral and psychophysiological studies are mixed, with some suggestion of specific impairments in reappraisal in anxiety. Results from neuroimaging studies broadly implicate altered functioning of amygdala-prefrontal cortical circuitries, although again, findings are mixed regarding specific patterns of altered neural functioning. Future work may benefit from focusing on designs that contrast effects of specific regulatory strategies, and isolate changes in emotional regulation from emotional reactivity. Approaches to improve treatments based on empirical evidence of disrupted emotion regulation in adolescents are also discussed. Future intervention studies might consider training and measurement of specific strategies in adolescents to better understand the role of emotion regulation as a treatment mechanism.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental illness characterized more by functional rather than structural brain abnormalities. The pattern of regional homogeneity (ReHo) deficits in MDD may relate to underlying regional hypoperfusion. Capturing this functional deficit pattern provides a brain pattern–based biomarker for MDD that is linked to the underlying pathophysiology.To examine whether cortical ReHo patterns provide a replicable biomarker for MDD that is more sensitive than reduced cortical thickness and evaluate whether the ReHo MDD deficit pattern reflects regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF) deficit patterns in MDD and whether a regional vulnerability index (RVI) thus constructed may provide a concise brain pattern-based biomarker for MDD.The UK Biobank (UKBB) participants had ReHo and structural measurements. Participants from the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium were included for measuring the MDD structural cortical deficit pattern. The UKBB ReHo and ENIGMA cortical thickness effect sizes for MDD were used to test the deficit patterns in the Amish Connectome Project (ACP) with ReHo, structural, and RCBF data. Finally, the Ament Clinic Inc (ACI) sample had RCBF data measured using single-photon emission computed tomography. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to September 2024.ReHo and structural measurements.Included in this analysis were 4 datasets: (1) UKBB (N = 4810 participants; 2220 with recurrent MDD and 2590 controls; mean [SD] age, 63.0 [7.5] years; 1121 female [50\%]), (2) ENIGMA (N = 10 115 participants; 2148 with MDD and 7957 healthy controls; mean [SD] age, 39.9 [10.0] years; 5927 female [59\%]), (3) ACP (N = 204 participants; 68 with a lifetime diagnosis of MDD and 136 controls; mean [SD] age, 41.0 [14.5] years; 104 female [51\%]), and (4) ACI (N = 372 participants; 296 with recurrent MDD and 76 controls; mean [SD] age, 45.3 [17.2] years; 189 female [51\%]). MDD participants had lower cortical ReHo in the cingulum, superior temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and several other areas, with no significant differences in cortical thickness. The regional pattern of ReHo MDD effect sizes was significantly correlated with that of RCBF obtained from 2 independent datasets (Pearson r = 0.52 and Pearson r = 0.46; P \&lt; 10−4). ReHo and RCBF functional RVIs showed numerically stronger effect sizes (Cohen d = 0.33-0.90) compared with structural RVIs (Cohen d = 0.09-0.20). Elevated ReHo-based RVI-MDD values in individuals with MDD were associated with higher depression symptom severity across cohorts.Results of this case-control study suggest that the ReHo MDD deficit pattern reflected cortical hypoperfusion and was regionally specific in MDD. ReHo-based RVI may serve as a sensitive functional biomarker for MDD.},

Another perspective holds that former attachment bonds are relinquished such that there is eventually no residual tie. The present study (N = 320) adjudicates between these alternatives. Results indicate that, for the average person, attachment bonds are gradually (4.18 years as a mid-point) relinquished after relationship termination: People’s former partners simply become someone they used to know. Results also indicate that the persistence of these bonds is moderated by several factors, including attachment orientations and continued contact with exes. Thus, even if the typical person does eventually “get over” their former partner, for some people, remnants of those bonds continue and never fully fade away.},

Four spaced pulses of either agonist elicit stronger and more sustained luciferase expression than a single “massed” pulse. Spaced pulses also result in stronger and more sustained activation of molecular factors critical for memory formation, ERK and CREB, and inhibition of ERK or CREB blocks the massed-spaced effect.

To test this hypothesis, we trained cortical organotypic slices on two temporal patterns using dual-optical stimulation. After 24-h of training, whole-cell recordings revealed network dynamics consistent with training-specific timed prediction. Unexpectedly, there was replay of the learned temporal structure during spontaneous activity. Furthermore, some neurons exhibited timed prediction errors as revealed by larger responses when the expected stimulus was omitted compared to when it was present. Mechanistically our results indicate that learning relied in part on asymmetric connectivity between distinct neuronal ensembles with temporally-ordered activation. These findings further suggest that local cortical microcircuits are intrinsically capable of learning temporal information and generating predictions, and that the learning rules underlying temporal learning and spontaneous replay can be intrinsic to local cortical microcircuits and not necessarily dependent on top-down interactions.},

This review provides a biologically plausible model of the neural mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior. We provide evidence from recent human brain imaging and animal studies that there is a heightened responsiveness to incentives and socioemotional contexts during this time, when impulse control is still relatively immature. These findings suggest differential development of bottom-up limbic systems, implicated in incentive and emotional processing, to top-down control systems during adolescence as compared to childhood and adulthood.

We provide a model for understanding how this vulnerability to depression arises, and why depression is so often precipitated by social rejection or loss of status during this phase. There is substantial remodeling and maturation of the dopaminergic reward system and the prefrontal cortex during adolescence, that coincides with the adolescent entering the complex world of adult peer and romantic relationships, where the rewards that can be obtained (feelings such as belonging, romantic love, status and agency) are abstract and temporally distant from the proximal context. Development of the prefrontal cortex makes it possible to pursue such complex and distal rewards, which are, however, tenuous and more readily frustrated than more immediate rewards. We hypothesize that when these distant rewards are frustrated they suppress the reward system, and that when such suppression is extensive and occurs for long enough, the clinical picture that results is one of depression.},

At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7–9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics’ behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.},

As these agents increasingly drive AI research and practical applications, their design, evaluation, and continuous improvement present intricate, multifaceted challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, framing intelligent agents within a modular, brain-inspired architecture that integrates principles from cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational research. We structure our exploration into four interconnected parts. First, we delve into the modular foundation of intelligent agents, systematically mapping their cognitive, perceptual, and operational modules onto analogous human brain functionalities, and elucidating core components such as memory, world modeling, reward processing, and emotion-like systems. Second, we discuss self-enhancement and adaptive evolution mechanisms, exploring how agents autonomously refine their capabilities, adapt to dynamic environments, and achieve continual learning through automated optimization paradigms, including emerging AutoML and LLM-driven optimization strategies. Third, we examine collaborative and evolutionary multi-agent systems, investigating the collective intelligence emerging from agent interactions, cooperation, and societal structures, highlighting parallels to human social dynamics. Finally, we address the critical imperative of building safe, secure, and beneficial AI systems, emphasizing intrinsic and extrinsic security threats, ethical alignment, robustness, and practical mitigation strategies necessary for trustworthy real-world deployment.},

	abstract = {The human brain exhibits a modular and hierarchical structure, spanning low-order sensorimotor to high-order cognitive/affective systems. What is the mechanistic significance of this organization for brain dynamics and information processing properties? We investigated this question using rare simultaneous multimodal electrophysiology (stereotactic and scalp electroencephalography - EEG) recordings in 36 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy during presurgical intracerebral electrical stimulation (iES) (323 stimulation sessions). Our analyses revealed an anatomical gradient of excitability across the cortex, with stronger iES-evoked EEG responses in high-order compared to low-order regions. Mathematical modeling further showed that this variation in excitability levels results from a differential dependence on recurrent feedback from non-stimulated regions across the anatomical hierarchy, and could be extinguished by suppressing those connections in-silico. High-order brain regions/networks thus show an activity pattern characterized by more inter-network functional integration than low-order ones, which manifests as a spatial gradient of excitability that is emergent from, and causally dependent on, the underlying hierarchical network structure. These findings offer new insights into how hierarchical brain organization influences cognitive functions and could inform strategies for targeted neuromodulation therapies.},

As research in multimodal stimuli and neuroscience advances, fMRI-based brain decoding has become a key tool for understanding brain perception and its complex cognitive processes. Decoding brain signals to reconstruct stimuli not only reveals intricate neural mechanisms but also drives progress in AI, disease treatment, and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advancements in neuroimaging and image generation models have significantly improved fMRI-based decoding. While fMRI offers high spatial resolution for precise brain activity mapping, its low temporal resolution and signal noise pose challenges. Meanwhile, techniques like GANs, VAEs, and Diffusion Models have enhanced reconstructed image quality, and multimodal pre-trained models have boosted cross-modal decoding tasks. This survey systematically reviews recent progress in fMRI-based brain decoding, focusing on stimulus reconstruction from passive brain signals. It summarizes datasets, relevant brain regions, and categorizes existing methods by model structure. Additionally, it evaluates model performance and discusses their effectiveness.

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents a substantial health burden with low treatment response rates. Predicting antidepressant efficacy is challenging due to MDD’s complex and varied neuropathology. Identifying biomarkers for antidepressant treatment requires thorough analysis of clinical trial data. Multimodal neuroimaging, combined with advanced data-driven methods, can enhance our understanding of the neurobiological processes influencing treatment outcomes. To address this, we analyzed resting-state fMRI and EEG connectivity data from 130 patients treated with sertraline and 135 patients with placebo from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study. A deep learning framework was developed using graph neural networks to integrate data-augmented connectivity and cross-modality correlation, aiming to predict individual symptom changes by revealing multimodal brain network signatures. The results showed that our model demonstrated promising prediction accuracy, with an R2 value of 0.24 for sertraline and 0.20 for placebo. It also exhibited potential in transferring predictions using only EEG. Key brain regions identified for predicting sertraline response included the inferior temporal gyrus (fMRI) and posterior cingulate cortex (EEG), while for placebo response, the precuneus (fMRI) and supplementary motor area (EEG) were critical. Additionally, both modalities identified the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex as significant for sertraline response, while the anterior cingulate cortex and postcentral gyrus were common predictors in the placebo arm. Additionally, variations in the frontoparietal control, ventral attention, dorsal attention, and limbic networks were notably associated with MDD treatment. By integrating fMRI and EEG, our study established novel multimodal brain network signatures to predict individual responses to sertraline and placebo in MDD, providing interpretable neural circuit patterns that may guide future targeted interventions.

In this Review, we consider how EV biomarkers can bring us closer to understanding the complex pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. We describe how translational research on EVs might unfold bidirectionally, proceeding from basic to clinical studies but also in the opposite direction, with biomarker findings in the clinic leading to novel hypotheses that can be tested in the laboratory. We demonstrate the potential value of EVs across all stages of the therapeutic development pipeline, from identifying therapeutic targets to the use of EVs as reporters in model systems and biomarkers in clinical research. Finally, we discuss how the cargo and physicochemical properties of naturally occurring and custom-engineered EVs can be leveraged as novel treatments and vehicles for drug delivery, potentially revolutionizing neurotherapeutics.},

This suggests that degree heterogeneity contributes to higher reconstructability. We validate this conclusion in empirical networks, where nodal degrees may not strictly adhere to power laws. Our results demonstrate that the reconstruction accuracy of degree-heterogeneous networks is indeed significantly higher than that of their randomized counterparts.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental illness characterized more by functional rather than structural brain abnormalities. The pattern of regional homogeneity (ReHo) deficits in MDD may relate to underlying regional hypoperfusion. Capturing this functional deficit pattern provides a brain pattern–based biomarker for MDD that is linked to the underlying pathophysiology.To examine whether cortical ReHo patterns provide a replicable biomarker for MDD that is more sensitive than reduced cortical thickness and evaluate whether the ReHo MDD deficit pattern reflects regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF) deficit patterns in MDD and whether a regional vulnerability index (RVI) thus constructed may provide a concise brain pattern-based biomarker for MDD.The UK Biobank (UKBB) participants had ReHo and structural measurements. Participants from the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium were included for measuring the MDD structural cortical deficit pattern. The UKBB ReHo and ENIGMA cortical thickness effect sizes for MDD were used to test the deficit patterns in the Amish Connectome Project (ACP) with ReHo, structural, and RCBF data. Finally, the Ament Clinic Inc (ACI) sample had RCBF data measured using single-photon emission computed tomography. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to September 2024.ReHo and structural measurements.Included in this analysis were 4 datasets: (1) UKBB (N = 4810 participants; 2220 with recurrent MDD and 2590 controls; mean [SD] age, 63.0 [7.5] years; 1121 female [50\%]), (2) ENIGMA (N = 10 115 participants; 2148 with MDD and 7957 healthy controls; mean [SD] age, 39.9 [10.0] years; 5927 female [59\%]), (3) ACP (N = 204 participants; 68 with a lifetime diagnosis of MDD and 136 controls; mean [SD] age, 41.0 [14.5] years; 104 female [51\%]), and (4) ACI (N = 372 participants; 296 with recurrent MDD and 76 controls; mean [SD] age, 45.3 [17.2] years; 189 female [51\%]). MDD participants had lower cortical ReHo in the cingulum, superior temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and several other areas, with no significant differences in cortical thickness. The regional pattern of ReHo MDD effect sizes was significantly correlated with that of RCBF obtained from 2 independent datasets (Pearson r = 0.52 and Pearson r = 0.46; P \&lt; 10−4). ReHo and RCBF functional RVIs showed numerically stronger effect sizes (Cohen d = 0.33-0.90) compared with structural RVIs (Cohen d = 0.09-0.20). Elevated ReHo-based RVI-MDD values in individuals with MDD were associated with higher depression symptom severity across cohorts.Results of this case-control study suggest that the ReHo MDD deficit pattern reflected cortical hypoperfusion and was regionally specific in MDD. ReHo-based RVI may serve as a sensitive functional biomarker for MDD.},

Studies employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) identified increased activation in specific brain regions during different cognitive states. However, the neural processes during the performance of an intelligence test remains largely unknown. This study considers intelligence as a whole-brain network phenomenon and investigates how the connectedness of specific brain regions contributes to performance on the Raven Progressive Matrices (RAPM), a well-established intelligence test. Connectedness was characterized with graph-theoretical measures based on functional connectivity derived from fMRI BOLD (N=67) and EEG theta-band (N=128) activity. The results reveal that the extent to which specific frontal and parietal regions are connected to other brain systems during intelligence testing relates to individual test performance. These regions may act as controllers, enabling flexible and efficient switches between cognitive states required to excel in intelligence tests.},

Our focus is on disturbances in thought, language, and communication associated with depression, alongside the relevant subjective experiences.

We review the disruption of brain networks associated with FTD, such as the salience, language, and default mode networks, within the context of depression. In conclusion, we advocate for increased focus on personal narratives, computational psychopathology, and a broader emphasis on thought dynamics to enhance the identification of disorganisation in depression. Renewed emphasis on this neglected area of psychopathology could provide insights on improving employment and social functioning for individuals affected by mood disorders.},

	abstract = {Neuroinflammation is a feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, and is quantified in vivo by PET imaging with radioligands for the translocator protein (TSPO, e.g. [11C]-PK11195). TSPO radioligand binding correlates with clinical severity and predicts clinical progression. However, the cellular substrate of altered TSPO binding is controversial and requires neuropathological validation.We used progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) as a demonstrator condition, to test the hypothesis that [11C]-PK11195 PET reflects microglial changes. We included people with PSP-Richardson’s syndrome who had undergone [11C]-PK11195 PET in life (n=8). In post-mortem brain tissue from the same participants, we characterised cell-type specific TSPO expression and quantified microgliosis in eight cortical and eleven subcortical regions.Double-immunofluorescence labelling for TSPO and cell markers showed TSPO expression in microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Microglial (and not astrocytic) TSPO levels were higher in donors with PSP compared to controls (n=3), and correlated with changes in microglial density. There was a significant positive correlation between regional [11C]-PK11195 binding potential ante-mortem and the density of post-mortem CD68+ phagocytic microglia, as well as microglial TSPO levels.We conclude that in vivo disease-related changes in [11C]-PK11195 binding is largely driven by microglia and can be interpreted as a biomarker of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in tauopathies.},

	abstract = {It was probably Study who first considered the possible positions of a rigid body as points in a non-Euclidian space; see Study [118]. His idea was to specify the position of the body by attaching a coordinate frame to it. He called these ‘points’ soma, which is Greek for body. He then used dual quaternions as coordinates for the space. As we saw in Section 9.3, using the dual quaternion representation, the elements of the group of rigid body motions can be thought of as the points of a six-dimensional projective quadric (excluding a 3-plane of ‘ideal’ points). If we fix a particular position of the rigid body as the home position, then all other positions of the body can be described by the unique transformation that takes the home configuration to the present one. In this way, we see that Study’s somas are just the points of the six-dimensional projective quadric, the Study quadric, (not forgetting to exclude the points on the special 3-plane).},

This is because we are only dealing with three joints, and since the joints are all revolute, intersecting at a single point, we can reduce everything to the rotation group SO(3). So consider a three-joint wrist, as in Figure 5.1, with the joint axes aligned along the unit vectors v1, v2 and v3. These are the home positions of the axes, and we will assume that these vectors are linearly independent. If the home position of the wrist has linearly dependent joint axes, then we can always move it a little and use a non-singular home position.},

This followed from the nineteenth century’s concentration on invariants and covariants. Crudely speaking invariants are trivial representations and covariants are just elements of some non-trivial representation. The significance of these ideas is that if we want to write down equations and relations in terms of coordinates then we expect that if we change coordinates then the geometry or mechanics expressed in our equations should not be altered. The simplest way to do this is to make sure that the expressions are equalities between invariants, but we can also use relations between covariants—so long as the covariants we compare correspond to the same representation. The upshot of this that whenever we want to study some new kind of object, a line, an ellipsoid or an inertia matrix perhaps, then we should always ask how the new object transforms under a change of coordinates, that is, which representation does the object belong to?},

However, news of this revolution was slow to spread in some areas, particularly in kinematics. So Study and latter Blaschke [12] and Dimentberg [27] continued to develop ‘dual quaternions’ and applied them to the theory of mechanisms. Mathematicians never really forgot about these things, although the real impetus to look at these structures afresh came when physicists rediscovered them.

We designed and used deep learning recurrent neural network transducer models to achieve online large-vocabulary intelligible fluent speech synthesis personalized to the participant’s preinjury voice with neural decoding in 80-ms increments. Offline, the models demonstrated implicit speech detection capabilities and could continuously decode speech indefinitely, enabling uninterrupted use of the decoder and further increasing speed. Our framework also successfully generalized to other silent-speech interfaces, including single-unit recordings and electromyography.

To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my queue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency.},

No serious perioperative or stimulation-related adverse events were encountered, with participants demonstrating a seven-point median improvement on the Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment. All individuals who enrolled with partial preservation of distal motor function exceeded minimal clinically important difference regardless of time since stroke, with a median improvement of 15 Upper-Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment points. These robust functional gains were directly correlated with cortical reorganization evidenced by increased ipsilesional metabolism.

However, specialised neural systems are also in constant competition for limited processing resources. How does the brain’s network architecture enable it to balance these cooperative and competitive tendencies? Here we use computational whole-brain modelling to examine the dynamical and computational relevance of cooperative and competitive interactions in the mammalian connectome. Across human, macaque, and mouse we show that the architecture of the models that most faithfully reproduce brain activity, consistently combines modular cooperative interactions with diffuse, long-range competitive interactions. The model with competitive interactions consistently outperforms the cooperative-only model, with excellent fit to both spatial and dynamical properties of the living brain, which were not explicitly optimised but rather emerge spontaneously. Competitive interactions in the effective connectivity produce greater levels of synergistic information and local-global hierarchy, and lead to superior computational capacity when used for neuromorphic computing.

	abstract = {The connection patterns of neural circuits in the brain form a complex network. Collective signalling within the network manifests as patterned neural activity and is thought to support human cognition and adaptive behaviour. Recent technological advances permit macroscale reconstructions of biological brain networks. These maps, termed connectomes, display multiple non-random architectural features, including heavy-tailed degree distributions, segregated communities and a densely interconnected core. Yet, how computation and functional specialization emerge from network architecture remains unknown. Here we reconstruct human brain connectomes using in vivo diffusion-weighted imaging and use reservoir computing to implement connectomes as artificial neural networks. We then train these neuromorphic networks to learn a memory-encoding task. We show that biologically realistic neural architectures perform best when they display critical dynamics. We find that performance is driven by network topology and that the modular organization of intrinsic networks is computationally relevant. We observe a prominent interaction between network structure and dynamics throughout, such that the same underlying architecture can support a wide range of memory capacity values as well as different functions (encoding or decoding), depending on the dynamical regime the network is in. This work opens new opportunities to discover how the network organization of the brain optimizes cognitive capacity.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents the leading cause of mental health disability for young people worldwide but remains poorly understood. Previous neuroimaging research has indicated alterations in the connectivity of brain circuitry in youth MDD; however, findings have been inconsistent. This may relate to limitations in sample size and sample and methodological heterogeneity. In an effort to delineate robust neurobiological markers of youth MDD, we conducted a data-driven, connectome-wide mega-analysis of resting-state functional connectivity in 810 young individuals across 7 independent cohorts with a cross-sectional and case-control design. Compared with healthy comparison individuals (n = 370), youth MDD (n = 440) was associated with significant alterations in connectivity of densely connected brain areas (hubs), anchored in the default mode and dorsal and ventral attention networks. Critically, functional connectivity within these networks was significantly associated with depression symptom severity (r = –0.46 for hypoconnected regions and r = 0.53 for hyperconnected regions; both P values {\textless} 0.001), indicating the clinical relevance of functional connectivity alterations. Further, machine-learning analyses demonstrated that individual diagnostic status (AUC = 73.1\%) and clinical severity (r = 0.14, P = 0.008) could be predicted on the basis of functional connectivity alone in unseen data using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Together, our work represents an important first step toward robust characterization of the neurobiological basis of youth depression. We demonstrate the clinical relevance of brain connectivity in youth depression and highlight a critical role of functional hub regions, especially those localized to the default mode and dorsal and ventral attention networks in youth MDD.},

	abstract = {Visual art represents a powerful resource for mental and physical well-being. However, little is known about the underlying effects at a neural level. A critical question is whether visual art production and cognitive art evaluation may have different effects on the functional interplay of the brain's default mode network (DMN). We used fMRI to investigate the DMN of a non-clinical sample of 28 post-retirement adults (63.71 years ±3.52 SD) before (T0) and after (T1) weekly participation in two different 10-week-long art interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to groups stratified by gender and age. In the visual art production group 14 participants actively produced art in an art class. In the cognitive art evaluation group 14 participants cognitively evaluated artwork at a museum. The DMN of both groups was identified by using a seed voxel correlation analysis (SCA) in the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC/preCUN). An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was employed to relate fMRI data to psychological resilience which was measured with the brief German counterpart of the Resilience Scale (RS-11). We observed that the visual art production group showed greater spatial improvement in functional connectivity of PCC/preCUN to the frontal and parietal cortices from T0 to T1 than the cognitive art evaluation group. Moreover, the functional connectivity in the visual art production group was related to psychological resilience (i.e., stress resistance) at T1. Our findings are the first to demonstrate the neural effects of visual art production on psychological resilience in adulthood.},

	abstract = {Objective
The association between depression and educational attainment in young people is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the longitudinal association between depression and subsequent attainment, and its potential effect modifiers and mediators.

Method
We searched Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and the British Education Index from inception to October 23, 2019, conducted citation searching, and contacted authors for articles. Eligible studies reported on the longitudinal association between depression in children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age and later educational attainment. Two reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Correlation coefficients were pooled in meta-analysis, and effect modifiers were explored using meta-regression and stratification. Other evidence on confounders, modifiers, and mediators was narratively synthesized. The PROSPERO record for the study is CRD42019123068.

Results
A total of 31 studies were included, of which 22 were pooled in meta-analysis. There was a small but statistically significant association between depression and lower subsequent attainment (pooled Fisher z = −0.19, 95\% CI = −0.22 to −0.16, I2 = 62.9\%). A total of 15 studies also reported an enduring effect after adjusting for various confounders. No statistically significant effect modifiers were identified. Social and school problems may mediate between depression and low attainment.

Conclusion
Depression was associated with lower educational attainment, but further research is needed to establish mechanisms. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for mental health and educational support among children and adolescents with depression.},

Going beyond establishing the type of observed alterations found in diagnosed patients and related cohorts, computational methods can yield valuable insights into the underlying disruptions of neural mechanisms and cognitive function. Here, we adopt a typology of model-based approaches from computational cognitive neuroscience, providing an overview of the study of mismatch responses and their alterations in schizophrenia from four complementary perspectives: (a) connectivity models, (b) decoding models, (c) neural network models, and (d) cognitive models. Connectivity models aim at inferring the effective connectivity patterns between brain regions that may underlie mismatch responses measured at the sensor level. Decoding models use multivariate spatiotemporal mismatch response patterns to infer the type of sensory violations or to classify participants based on their diagnosis. Neural network models such as deep convolutional neural networks can be used for improved classification performance as well as for a systematic study of various aspects of empirical data. Finally, cognitive models quantify mismatch responses in terms of signaling and updating perceptual predictions over time. In addition to describing the available methodology and reviewing the results of recent computational psychiatry studies, we offer suggestions for future work applying model-based techniques to advance the study of mismatch responses in schizophrenia.},

The aim of the current study was to compare the generative mechanisms of the MMN and visual LTP, therefore assessing whether Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms co-occur in the brain. Forty participants were presented with both paradigms during EEG recording. Consistent with Predictive Coding and Hebbian predictions, Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed that the generation of the MMN modulates forward and backward connections in the underlying network, while visual LTP only modulates forward connections. These results suggest that both Predictive Coding and Hebbian mechanisms are utilized by the brain under different task demands. This therefore indicates that both tasks provide unique insight into plasticity mechanisms, which has important implications for future studies of aberrant plasticity in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Plasticity can be induced in human cortex using paired associative stimulation (PAS), which repeatedly and predictably pairs a peripheral electrical stimulus with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the contralateral motor region. Many studies have reported small or inconsistent effects of PAS. Given that uncertain stimuli can promote learning, the predictable nature of the stimulation in conventional PAS paradigms might serve to attenuate plasticity induction. Here, we introduced stimulus uncertainty into the PAS paradigm to investigate if it can boost plasticity induction. Across two experimental sessions, participants (n = 28) received a modified PAS paradigm consisting of a random combination of 90 paired stimuli and 90 unpaired (TMS-only) stimuli. Prior to each of these stimuli, participants also received an auditory cue which either reliably predicted whether the upcoming stimulus was paired or unpaired (no uncertainty condition) or did not predict the upcoming stimulus (maximum uncertainty condition). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle quantified cortical excitability before and after PAS. MEP amplitude increased significantly 15 min following PAS in the maximum uncertainty condition. There was no reliable change in MEP amplitude in the no uncertainty condition, nor between post-PAS MEP amplitudes across the two conditions. These results suggest that stimulus uncertainty may provide a novel means to enhance plasticity induction with the PAS paradigm in human motor cortex. To provide further support to the notion that stimulus uncertainty and prediction error promote plasticity, future studies should further explore the time course of these changes, and investigate what aspects of stimulus uncertainty are critical in boosting plasticity.},

This circuitry, which involves projections from the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) region, can be linked to prediction error and expectation modulation of fear learning as described by associative and computational learning models. It controls whether, and how much, fear learning occurs by signalling aversive events when they are unexpected. Functional neuroimaging and clinical studies indicate that this prediction circuit is recruited in humans during fear learning and contributes to exposure-based treatments for clinical anxiety. This aversive prediction error circuit may represent a conserved mechanism for regulating fear learning in mammals.},

	abstract = {Rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures have caused substantial changes in terrestrial water circulation and land surface water fluxes, such as precipitation and evapotranspiration, potentially leading to abrupt shifts in terrestrial water storage. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) soil moisture (SM) product reveals a sharp depletion during the early 21st century. During the period 2000 to 2002, soil moisture declined by approximately 1614 gigatonnes, much larger than Greenland’s ice loss of about 900 gigatonnes (2002–2006). From 2003 to 2016, SM depletion continued, with an additional 1009-gigatonne loss. This depletion is supported by two independent observations of global mean sea level rise ({\textasciitilde}4.4 millimeters) and Earth’s pole shift ({\textasciitilde}45 centimeters). Precipitation deficits and stable evapotranspiration likely caused this decline, and SM has not recovered as of 2021, with future recovery unlikely under present climate conditions.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0208716},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are one of the most diagnosed mental health disorders. Common treatment consists of cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. In clinical practice, also art therapy is additionally provided to patients with anxiety (disorders), among others because treatment as usual is not sufficiently effective for a large group of patients. There is no clarity on the effectiveness of art therapy (AT) on the reduction of anxiety symptoms in adults and there is no overview of the intervention characteristics and working mechanisms.
METHODS: A systematic review of (non-)randomised controlled trials on AT for anxiety in adults to evaluate the effects on anxiety symptom severity and to explore intervention characteristics, benefitting populations and working mechanisms. Thirteen databases and two journals were searched for the period 1997 -October 2017. The study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42017080733) and performed according to the Cochrane recommendations. PRISMA Guidelines were used for reporting.
RESULTS: Only three publications out of 776 hits from the search fulfilled the inclusion criteria: three RCTs with 162 patients in total. All studies have a high risk of bias. Study populations were: students with PTSD symptoms, students with exam anxiety and prisoners with prelease anxiety. Visual art techniques varied: trauma-related mandala design, collage making, free painting, clay work, still life drawing and house-tree-person drawing. There is some evidence of effectiveness of AT for pre-exam anxiety in undergraduate students. AT is possibly effective in reducing pre-release anxiety in prisoners. The AT characteristics varied and narrative synthesis led to hypothesized working mechanisms of AT: induce relaxation; gain access to unconscious traumatic memories, thereby creating possibilities to investigate cognitions; and improve emotion regulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of AT on anxiety has hardly been studied, so no strong conclusions can be drawn. This emphasizes the need for high quality trials studying the effectiveness of AT on anxiety.},

We used the Society for Prevention Research's Standards of Evidence (Flay et al., 2005 ) to evaluate the degree to which existing depression prevention programs have established intervention efficacy, effectiveness, and readiness for dissemination. We reviewed all depression prevention programs for youth that have been evaluated in at least two published, randomized controlled trials in which the intervention was compared to a no-intervention control group. A total of 37 studies evaluating 11 different programs were reviewed with regard to depressive symptoms and diagnoses at postintervention and follow-up (at least 6 months). Eight programs demonstrated significant main effects on depressive symptoms relative to controls in multiple randomized controlled trials; 5 programs had at least 1 trial with significant main effects present at least 1 year postintervention. Two programs demonstrated efficacy for both depressive symptoms and depressive episodes across multiple independent trials. Regarding effectiveness, 6 programs had at least 1 study showing significant effects when delivered by endogenous service providers; 4 programs had significant effects in studies conducted independently of the program developers. Several programs have demonstrated promise in terms of efficacy, but no depression prevention program for children or adolescents as yet has garnered sufficient evidence of effectiveness under real-world conditions to warrant widespread dissemination at this time.},

	abstract = {Across 5 decades, hundreds of randomized trials have tested psychological therapies for youth internalizing (anxiety, depression) and externalizing (misconduct, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) disorders and problems. Since the last broad-based youth meta-analysis in 1995, the number of trials has almost tripled and data-analytic methods have been refined. We applied these methods to the expanded study pool (447 studies; 30,431 youths), synthesizing 50 years of findings and identifying implications for research and practice. We assessed overall effect size (ES) and moderator effects using multilevel modeling to address ES dependency that is common, but typically not modeled, in meta-analyses. Mean posttreatment ES was 0.46; the probability that a youth in the treatment condition would fare better than a youth in the control condition was 63\%. Effects varied according to multiple moderators, including the problem targeted in treatment: Mean ES at posttreatment was strongest for anxiety (0.61), weakest for depression (0.29), and nonsignificant for multiproblem treatment (0.15). ESs differed across control conditions, with "usual care" emerging as a potent comparison condition, and across informants, highlighting the need to obtain and integrate multiple perspectives on outcome. Effects of therapy type varied by informant; only youth-focused behavioral therapies (including cognitive-behavioral therapy) showed similar and robust effects across youth, parent, and teacher reports. Effects did not differ for Caucasian versus minority samples, but more diverse samples are needed. The findings underscore the benefits of psychological treatments as well as the need for improved therapies and more representative, informative, and rigorous intervention science.

Given the emphasis on rodent models for mechanistic studies, there is a need for characterization of the effect of psilocybin on cortex-wide network dynamics. Previous electroencephalographic studies of psychedelics in rodents have primarily used sparse electrode arrays with limited spatial resolution, precluding network level analysis, and have been restricted to lower gamma frequencies. Therefore, in this study, we used electroencephalographic recordings from 27 sites/electrodes across rat cortex (n = 6 male, 6 female) to characterize the effect of psilocybin (0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg delivered over an hour) on brain network organization as inferred through changes in node degree (an index of network density) and connection strength (via weighted phase-lag index). The removal of aperiodic component from the electroencephalogram localized the primary oscillatory changes to theta (4-10 Hz), medium gamma (70-110 Hz), and high gamma (110-150 Hz) bands, which were used for the network analysis. Additionally, we determined the concurrent changes in theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. We report that psilocybin, in a dose-dependent manner, 1) disrupted theta-gamma coupling [p {\textless} 0.05], 2) increased frontal high gamma connectivity [p {\textless} 0.05] and posterior theta connectivity [p ≤ 0.049], and 3) increased frontal high gamma [p {\textless} 0.05] and posterior theta [p ≤ 0.046] network density. The behavioral activity and the medium gamma frontoparietal connectivity showed an inverted-U relationship with psilocybin dose. Our results suggest that high-frequency network organization, decoupled from local theta-phase, may be an important signature of psilocybin-induced non-ordinary state of consciousness.},

This therapeutic approach is based on the therapist’s aesthetic experience of his/her embodied presence in the flow of the healing process because (1) the perception of beauty can provide the therapist with feedback on the assimilation of unprocessed experiences; (2) the therapist’s attentional focus on intrinsic aesthetic diagnostic criteria can facilitate the modification of rigid psychopathological fields by supporting the openness to novel experiences. The aim of the present manuscript is to review recent evidence from psychophysiology, neuroaesthetic research, and neurocomputational models of cognition, such as the free energy principle (FEP), which support the notion of the therapeutic potential of aesthetic sensibility in Gestalt psychotherapy. Drawing from neuroimaging data, psychophysiology and recent neurocognitive accounts of aesthetic perception, we propose a novel interpretation of the sense of beauty as a self-generated reward motivating us to assimilate an ever-greater spectrum of sensory and affective states in our predictive representation of ourselves and the world and supporting the intentionality of contact. Expecting beauty, in the psychotherapeutic encounter, can help therapists tolerate uncertainty avoiding impulsive behaviours and to stay tuned to the process of change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Discriminative Graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine with differential entropy features achieves the best average accuracies of 69.67 and 91.07 percent on the DEAP and SEED datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that stable patterns exhibit consistency across sessions; the lateral temporal areas activate more for positive emotions than negative emotions in beta and gamma bands; the neural patterns of neutral emotions have higher alpha responses at parietal and occipital sites; and for negative emotions, the neural patterns have significant higher delta responses at parietal and occipital sites and higher gamma responses at prefrontal sites. The performance of our emotion recognition models shows that the neural patterns are relatively stable within and between sessions.},

By transmitting only the unpredicted portions of an incoming sensory signal, predictive coding allows the nervous system to reduce redundancy and make full use of the limited dynamic range of neurons. Starting with the hypothesis of efficient coding as a design principle in the sensory system, predictive coding provides a functional explanation for a range of neural responses and many aspects of brain organization. The lateral and temporal antagonism in receptive fields in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus occur naturally as a consequence of predictive coding of natural images. In the higher visual system, predictive coding provides an explanation for oriented receptive fields and contextual effects as well as the hierarchical reciprocally connected organization of the cortex. Predictive coding has also been found to be consistent with a variety of neurophysiological and psychophysical data obtained from different areas of the brain.

	abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.

It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective.

In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

	abstract = {Many of the sensations experienced by an organism are caused by their own actions, and accurately anticipating both the sensory features and timing of self-generated stimuli is crucial to a variety of behaviors. In the auditory cortex, neural responses to self-generated sounds exhibit frequency-specific suppression, suggesting that movement-based predictions may be implemented early in sensory processing. Yet it remains unknown whether this modulation results from a behaviorally specific and temporally precise prediction, nor is it known whether corresponding expectation signals are present locally in the auditory cortex. To address these questions, we trained mice to expect the precisely timed acoustic outcome of a forelimb movement using a closed-loop sound-generating lever. Dense neuronal recordings in the auditory cortex revealed suppression of responses to self-generated sounds that was specific to the expected acoustic features, specific to a precise time within the movement, and specific to the movement that was coupled to sound during training. Predictive suppression was concentrated in L2/3 and L5, where deviations from expectation also recruited a population of prediction-error neurons that was otherwise unresponsive. Recording in the absence of sound revealed abundant movement signals in deep layers that were biased toward neurons tuned to the expected sound, as well as temporal expectation signals that were present throughout the cortex and peaked at the time of expected auditory feedback. Together, these findings reveal that predictive processing in the mouse auditory cortex is consistent with a learned internal model linking a specific action to its temporally precise acoustic outcome, while identifying distinct populations of neurons that anticipate expected stimuli and differentially process expected versus unexpected outcomes.},

Here, we compared neuronal activity in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 of barrel cortex using calcium imaging in mice running in a tactile virtual reality. Both layers increase their activity during running and concomitant whisking, in the absence of touch. Fewer neurons are modulated by whisking alone. Whereas L5 neurons respond transiently to wall-touch during running, L2/3 neurons show sustained activity. Consistently, neurons encoding running-with-touch are more abundant in L2/3 and they encode the run-speed better during touch. Few neurons across layers were also sensitive to abrupt perturbations of tactile flow during running. In summary, locomotion significantly enhances barrel cortex activity across layers with L5 neurons mainly reporting changes in touch conditions and L2/3 neurons continually integrating tactile stimuli with running.},

	abstract = {Songbirds are capable of vocal learning and communication and are ideally suited to the study of neural mechanisms of complex sensory and motor processing. Vocal communication in a noisy bird colony and vocal learning of a specific song template both require the ability to monitor auditory feedback to distinguish self-generated vocalizations from external sounds and to identify mismatches between the developing song and a memorized template acquired from a tutor. However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.},

	abstract = {Vocal communication involves both speaking and hearing, often taking place concurrently. Vocal production, including human speech and animal vocalization, poses a number of unique challenges for the auditory system. It is important for the auditory system to monitor external sounds continuously from the acoustic environment during speaking despite the potential for sensory masking by self-generated sounds. It is also essential for the auditory system to monitor feedback of one's own voice. This self-monitoring may play a part in distinguishing between self-generated or externally generatedauditory inputs and in detecting errors in our vocal production. Previous work in humans and other animals has demonstrated that the auditory cortex is largely suppressed during speaking or vocalizing. Despite the importance of self-monitoring, the underlying neural mechanisms in the mammalian brain, in particular the role of vocalization-induced suppression, remain virtually unknown. Here we show that neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) are sensitive to auditory feedback during vocal production, and that changes in the feedback alter the coding properties of these neurons. Furthermore, we found that the previously described cortical suppression during vocalization actually increased the sensitivity of these neurons to vocal feedback. This heightened sensitivity to vocal feedback suggests that these neurons may have an important role in auditory self-monitoring.},

In traditional physical applications, the RG largely builds on the notions of homogeneity, symmetry, geometry and locality to define metric distances, scale transformations and self-similar coarse-graining schemes. More recently, efforts have been made to extend RG concepts to complex networks. However, in such systems, explicit geometric coordinates do not necessarily exist, different nodes and subgraphs can have different statistical properties, and homogeneous lattice-like symmetries are absent — all features that make it complicated to define consistent renormalization procedures.

	abstract = {It is challenging to measure how specific aspects of coordinated neural dynamics translate into operations of information processing and, ultimately, cognitive functions. An obstacle is that simple circuit mechanisms—such as self-sustained or propagating activity and nonlinear summation of inputs—do not directly give rise to high-level functions. Nevertheless, they already implement simple the information carried by neural activity. Here, we propose that distinct functions, such as stimulus representation, working memory, or selective attention, stem from different combinations and types of low-level manipulations of information or information processing primitives. To test this hypothesis, we combine approaches from information theory with simulations of multi-scale neural circuits involving interacting brain regions that emulate well-defined cognitive functions. Specifically, we track the information dynamics emergent from patterns of neural dynamics, using quantitative metrics to detect where and when information is actively buffered, transferred or nonlinearly merged, as possible modes of low-level processing (storage, transfer and modification). We find that neuronal subsets maintaining representations in working memory or performing attentional gain modulation are signaled by their boosted involvement in operations of information storage or modification, respectively. Thus, information dynamic metrics, beyond detecting which network units participate in cognitive processing, also promise to specify how and when they do it, that is, through which type of primitive computation, a capability that may be exploited for the analysis of experimental recordings.},

	abstract = {Predictive coding frameworks suggest that neural computations rely on hierarchical error minimization, where sensory signals are evaluated against internal model predictions. However, the neural implementation of this inference process remains unclear. We propose that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) furnishes a fundamental mechanism for this form of inference. We first demonstrate that our previously described Laminar Neural Mass Model (LaNMM) supports two key forms of CFC: (i) Signal-Envelope Coupling (SEC), where low-frequency rhythms modulate the amplitude envelope of higher-frequency oscillations and (ii) Envelope-Envelope Coupling (EEC), where the envelopes of slower oscillations modulate the envelopes of higher-frequency rhythms. Then, we propose that, by encoding information in signals and their envelopes, these processes instantiate a hierarchical "Comparator" mechanism at the columnar level. Specifically, SEC generates fast prediction-error signals by subtracting top-down predictions from bottom-up oscillatory envelopes, while EEC operates at slower timescales to instantiate gating---a critical computational mechanism for precision-weighting and selective information routing. To establish the face validity and clinical implications of this proposal, we model perturbations of these CFC mechanisms to investigate their roles in pathophysiological and altered neuronal function. We illustrate how, in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, disruptions in gamma oscillations following dysfunction in fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons impact Comparator function with an aberrant amplification of prediction errors in the early stages and a drastic attenuation in late phases of the disease. In contrast, by increasing excitatory gain, serotonergic psychedelics diminish the modulatory effect of predictions, resulting in a failure to attenuate prediction error signals (c.f., a failure of sensory attenuation). Collectively, these findings implicate cross‐frequency coupling across multiple temporal scales as a key computational mechanism supporting predictive coding and suggest that disruptions in these processes play a central role in disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline underpinned by disruptions in neural circuit dynamics. Early-stage AD is associated with cortical hyperexcitability, whereas later stages exhibit oscillatory slowing and hypoactivity, a progression observable in electrophysiological spectral characteristics. While previous studies have linked these changes to the dysfunction of fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons and neuronal loss associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (hptau) pathology, the precise mechanistic relationship between cellular and altered electrophysiology remains unclear. To study this relationship, we employed a Laminar Neural Mass Model that integrates excitatory and inhibitory neural populations within a biophysically informed columnar framework. The connectivity constant from PV cells to pyramidal neurons was gradually reduced to simulate the progressive neurotoxic effects of Abeta oligomers. Other model parameters were systematically varied to compare with existing modeling literature and also to simulate the effects of hptau. All model predictions were compared to empirical M/EEG findings in the literature. Our simulations of PV interneuron dysfunction successfully reproduced the biphasic electrophysiological progression observed in AD: an early phase of hyperexcitability with increased gamma and alpha power, followed by oscillatory slowing and reduced spectral power. Alternative mechanisms and model parameters, such as increased excitatory drive, failed to replicate the observed biomarker trajectory. Additionally, to reconcile the hypoactivity and decreased firing rates observed in advanced AD stages, we combined the PV dysfunction model with a disruption of the pyramidal cell populations that reflects the neurotoxicity induced by hptau. Although this additional mechanism is not necessary to reproduce oscillatory changes in the isolated neural mass, it is crucial for aligning the model with evidence of reduced firing rates, metabolic activity, and cell loss and will enhance its applicability in future whole-brain modeling studies. These results support the hypothesis that at the local level, PV interneuron dysfunction is a primary driver of cortical electrophysiological alterations, while pyramidal neuron loss underlies later-stage severe hypoactivity. Our model provides a mechanistic framework for interpreting excitation-inhibition imbalance across AD progression, demonstrating the value of biophysically constrained models for interpreting electrophysiological biomarkers.},

Using multimodal neuroimaging data from thirty subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, we simulate the impact of serotonin 2A receptor activation, characteristic of psychedelics, on cortical dynamics. By modulating the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, our models reproduce hallmark changes in EEG power spectra observed under psychedelics, including alpha power suppression and gamma power enhancement. These spectral shifts are shown to correlate strongly with the regional distribution of serotonin 2A receptors. Furthermore, simulated EEG reveals increased complexity and entropy, suggesting restored network function.

My investigations grew out of a study of the work of Charles Babbage’s earliest successors—in particular, the Irish pioneer Percy Ludgate—a study that led me to plan an overall historical account of the origins of the digital computer. The investigation resulted in my learning about a highly secret programmable electronic computer developed in Britain during the Second World War. I revealed that this computer was named Colossus, and had been built in 1943 for Bletchley Park, the UK government’s wartime codebreaking establishment. However, my attempt to get the details of the machine declassified were unsuccessful, and I came to the conclusion that it might be a long time before anything more would become public about Bletchley Park and Colossus. Around 1970, while I was seeking information about the work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace to use in my inaugural lecture at Newcastle University, I stumbled across the work of Percy Ludgate. In a paper he wrote about Babbage’s ‘automatic calculating engines’, Ludgate mentioned that he had also worked on the design of an Analytical Engine, indicating that he had described this in an earlier paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society.From a copy of that paper I learned that an apparently completely forgotten Irish inventor had taken up and developed Babbage’s ideas for what would now be called a program-controlled mechanical computer. Previously I had subscribed to the general belief that over a century had passed before anyone had followed up Babbage’s pioneering 1837 work on Analytical Engines. This discovery led me to undertake an intensive investigation of Ludgate, the results of which I published in the Computer Journal. With the help of a number of Irish librarians and archivists I managed to find out quite a few details about the tragically short life of this Irish accountant, and even to make contact with one of his relatives. Unfortunately, I found nothing more about his design for a paper-tapecontrolled analytical machine beyond what was given in his 1909 paper. My investigations into the background to Ludgate’s work left me with a considerable amount of information on pre-computer technology and on other little-known successors to Babbage.},

	abstract = {We examine the assumptions behind Noether's theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws. To compare classical and quantum versions of this theorem, we take an algebraic approach. In both classical and quantum mechanics, observables are naturally elements of a Jordan algebra, while generators of one-parameter groups of transformations are naturally elements of a Lie algebra. Noether's theorem holds whenever we can map observables to generators in such a way that each observable generates a one-parameter group that preserves itself. In ordinary complex quantum mechanics this mapping is multiplication by \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{-1\}\$. In the more general framework of unital JB-algebras, Alfsen and Shultz call such a mapping a "dynamical correspondence", and show its presence allows us to identify the unital JB-algebra with the self-adjoint part of a complex C*-algebra. However, to prove their result, they impose a second, more obscure, condition on the dynamical correspondence. We show this expresses a relation between quantum and statistical mechanics, closely connected to the principle that "inverse temperature is imaginary time".},

We combine the locations of brain abnormalities in IGE (131 coordinates from 21 studies) with the human connectome to identify an IGE network. We validate this network by showing alignment with structural brain abnormalities previously identified in IGE and brain areas activated by generalized epileptiform discharges in simultaneous electroencephalogram-functional magnetic resonance imaging. The topography of the IGE network aligns with brain networks involved in motor control and loss of consciousness consistent with generalized seizure semiology. To investigate therapeutic relevance, we analyze data from 21 patients with IGE treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for generalized seizures. Seizure frequency reduced a median 90\% after DBS and stimulation sites intersect an IGE network peak in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Together, this study helps unify prior findings in IGE and identify a brain network target that can be tested in clinical trials of brain stimulation to control generalized seizures.},

	abstract = {Previous literature has suggested a significant association between loneliness and depression. Importantly, research has shown that rumination can modulate the loneliness–depression relationship. However, most studies only treated loneliness, rumination or depression as unitary constructs. Considering the heterogeneity of the three concepts, we examined the relationship between specific loneliness, rumination items and depressive symptoms using the network analysis approach. In a large community adult sample (N = 900), we constructed the loneliness–depression and loneliness–rumination–depression network using a cross-sectional design. The results suggested that loneliness has no robust association with depressive symptoms. Instead, a connection between a specific ruminative thought (‘think about how alone you are’) and a specific loneliness item (‘how often do you feel alone’) is essential in maintaining the loneliness–rumination–depression network (partial r = 0.307). Our findings indicate that ruminating on the feeling of loneliness is the key underlying factor modulating the loneliness–depression relationship. Interventions for depression should focus on ameliorating ruminative thoughts, especially on loneliness feelings.},

Here, using longitudinal questionnaire data from the Nurses’ Health Study (1986–2016) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986–2016), we examined the association of long-term adherence to eight dietary patterns and ultraprocessed food consumption with healthy aging, as assessed according to measures of cognitive, physical and mental health, as well as living to 70 years of age free of chronic diseases. After up to 30 years of follow-up, 9,771 (9.3\%) of 105,015 participants (66\% women, mean age = 53 years (s.d. = 8)) achieved healthy aging. For each dietary pattern, higher adherence was associated with greater odds of healthy aging and its domains. The odds ratios for the highest quintile versus the lowest ranged from 1.45 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35–1.57; healthful plant-based diet) to 1.86 (95\% CI = 1.71–2.01; Alternative Healthy Eating Index). When the age threshold for healthy aging was shifted to 75 years, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index diet showed the strongest association with healthy aging, with an odds ratio of 2.24 (95\% CI = 2.01–2.50). Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes and low-fat dairy products were linked to greater odds of healthy aging, whereas higher intakes of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages and red or processed meats (or both) were inversely associated. Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may enhance overall healthy aging, guiding future dietary guidelines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Estimates of prevalence and burden of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) vary widely in the literature. This study evaluated the prevalence and burden of TRD and the share of TRD in the burden of medication-treated major depressive disorder (MDD) using the most commonly accepted definition of TRD and a novel bottom-up approach.
METHODS: Prevalence and health care burden of TRD were estimated by synthetizing inputs across 4 similarly designed claims studies in adults covered by Medicare, Medicaid, commercial plans, and the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and unemployment burden were estimated based on inputs from a study conducted with data from the Kantar National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS; 2017). A targeted literature search for additional inputs was performed. A cost model was developed to estimate the burden of TRD and medication-treated DSM-5-defined MDD in the United States. Study outcomes were the 12-month prevalence of TRD and the annual health care, productivity, and unemployment burden of TRD and medication-treated MDD in the United States.
RESULTS: The estimated 12-month prevalence of medication-treated MDD in the United States was 8.9 million adults, and 2.8 million (30.9\%) had TRD. The total annual burden of medication-treated MDD among the US population was \$92.7 billion, with \$43.8 billion (47.2\%) attributable to TRD. The share of TRD was 56.6\% (\$25.8 billion) of the health care burden, 47.7\% (\$8.7 billion) of the unemployment burden, and 32.2\% (\$9.3 billion) of the productivity burden of medication-treated MDD.
CONCLUSIONS: TRD is associated with disproportionate health care costs and unemployment, suggesting potentially large economic and societal gains with effective management.},

We identify a disease-associated subset of capillary ECs in Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal degeneration. These capillaries exhibit reduced nuclear β-catenin and β-catenin-downstream genes, along with elevated TNF/NF-κB markers. Notably, these transcriptional changes correlate with the loss of nuclear TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein also depleted in neuronal nuclei. TDP-43 disruption in human and mouse ECs replicates these alterations, suggesting that TDP-43 deficiency in ECs is an important factor contributing to blood–brain barrier breakdown in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots1,2. Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots3. How they navigate these design challenges is unclear4. Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network5. Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.},

	abstract = {It is frequently assumed that the phenotypic heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder reflects underlying pathobiological variation. However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we leverage cross-species functional neuroimaging to examine whether variability in brain functional connectivity reflects distinct biological mechanisms. We find that fMRI connectivity alterations in 20 distinct mouse models of autism (n=549 individual mice) can be clustered into two prominent hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes. We show that these connectivity profiles are linked to distinct signaling pathways, with hypoconnectivity being associated with synaptic dysfunction, and hyperconnectivity reflecting transcriptional and immune-related alterations. Extending these findings to humans, we identify analogous hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes in a large, multicenter resting state fMRI dataset of n=940 autistic and n=1036 neurotypical individuals. Remarkably, hypo- and hyperconnectivity autism subtypes are replicable across independent cohorts (accounting for 25.1\% of all autism data), exhibit distinct functional network architecture, are behaviorally dissociable, and recapitulate synaptic and immune mechanisms identified in corresponding mouse subtypes. Our cross-species investigation, thus, decodes the heterogeneity of fMRI connectivity in autism into distinct pathway-specific etiologies, offering a new empirical framework for targeted subtyping of autism.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium binding protein expressed by inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons in the cerebral cortex. By generating a fast stream of action potentials, PV+ interneurons provide a quick and stable inhibitory input to pyramidal neurons and contribute to the generation of gamma oscillations in the cortex. Their fast-firing rates, while advantageous for regulating cortical signaling, also leave them vulnerable to metabolic stress. Chandelier (Ch) cells are a type of PV+ interneuron that modulate the output of pyramidal neurons and synchronize spikes within neuron populations by directly innervating the pyramidal axon initial segment. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons, mostly of Ch cells, are linked to neurological disorders. In ASD, the number of PV+ Ch cells is decreased across several cortical areas. Changes in the morphology and/or function of PV+ interneurons have also been linked to schizophrenia, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. Herein, we review the role of PV and PV+ Ch cell alterations in ASD and other psychiatric disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Latest diagnostic criteria according to DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 2013) now include sensory issues among the four restricted/repetitive behavior features defined as “hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of environment”. Here, we review auditory sensory alterations in patients with ASD. Considering the updated diagnostic criteria for ASD, we examined research evidence (2015–2022) of the integrity of the cognitive function in auditory-related tasks, the integrity of the peripheral auditory system, and the integrity of the central nervous system in patients diagnosed with ASD. Taking into account the different approaches and experimental study designs, we reappraise the knowledge on auditory sensory alterations and reflect on how these might be linked with behavior symptomatology in ASD.},

	abstract = {Sensory attenuation, the top-down filtering or gating of afferent information, has been extensively studied in two fields: physiological and perceptual. Physiological sensory attenuation is represented as a decrease in the amplitude of the primary and secondary components of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) before and during movement. Perceptual sensory attenuation, described using the analogy of a persons' inability to tickle oneself, is a reduction in the perception of the afferent input of a self-produced tactile sensation due to the central cancellation of the reafferent signal by the efference copy of the motor command to produce the action. The fields investigating these two areas have remained isolated, so the relationship between them is unclear. The current study delivered median nerve stimulation to produce SEPs during a force-matching paradigm (used to quantify perceptual sensory attenuation) in healthy human subjects to determine whether SEP gating correlated with the behavior. Our results revealed that these two forms of attenuation have dissociable neurophysiological correlates and are likely functionally distinct, which has important implications for understanding neurological disorders in which one form of sensory attenuation but not the other is impaired. Time–frequency analyses revealed a negative correlation over sensorimotor cortex between gamma-oscillatory activity and the magnitude of perceptual sensory attenuation. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that gamma-band power is related to prediction error and that this might underlie perceptual sensory attenuation., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We demonstrate that there are two functionally and mechanistically distinct forms of sensory gating. The literature regarding somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) gating is commonly cited as a potential mechanism underlying perceptual sensory attenuation; however, the formal relationship between physiological and perceptual sensory attenuation has never been tested. Here, we measured SEP gating and perceptual sensory attenuation in a single paradigm and identified their distinct neurophysiological correlates. Perceptual and physiological sensory attenuation has been shown to be impaired in various patient groups, so understanding the differential roles of these phenomena and how they are modulated in a diseased state is very important for aiding our understanding of neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, functional movement disorders, and Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sensory attenuation (SA), the dampened perception of self-generated sensory information, is typically associated with reduced event-related potential signals, such as for the N1 component of auditory event-related potentials. SA, together with efficient monitoring of intentions and actions, should facilitate the distinction between self-generated and externally generated sensory events, thereby optimizing interaction with the world. According to many, SA is deficient in schizophrenia. The question arises whether altered SA reflects a sufficient mechanism to explain positive symptoms such as auditory hallucinations. A systematic association of reduced auditory SA in hallucinating patients would support this hypothesis.
METHODS: We conducted a series of meta-analyses on 15 studies on auditory SA in which the N1 component of event-related potential-electroencephalogram signals was measured during talking (self-generated sensory signals condition) or when listening to prerecorded vocalizations (externally generated sensory signals condition).
RESULTS: We found that individuals with schizophrenia did show some auditory SA because their N1 signal was significantly attenuated in talking conditions compared with listening conditions. However, the magnitude of such attenuation was reduced in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy control participants. This phenomenon generalizes independently from the stage of the disease, the severity of positive symptoms, and whether patients have auditory hallucinations or not.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reduced SA cannot be a sufficient mechanism for explaining positive symptoms such as auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Because reduced SA was also present in participants at risk of schizophrenia, reduced SA may represent a risk factor for the disorder. We discuss the implications of these results for clinical-cognitive models of schizophrenia.},

In particular, there has been a growth in studies concerning the intersection of psychedelics, Virtual Reality (VR), and Cognitive Flexibility (CF). Indeed, the use of immersive technology allows the simulation of the perceptual and cognitive effects of psychedelic substances without the potential risks associated with them. CF is strongly associated with creative cognition, a complex cognitive mechanism involved in creative thinking and associated with the prefrontal cortex and the neural networks supporting executive functions, memory, attention, and spontaneous modes of thought. The Bayesian brain approach, which is rooted in predictive coding, has emerged as a promising framework for understanding the effects of psychedelic hallucinations on cognitive functioning. Psychedelic substances may enhance creativity by inducing a state of CF, allowing for a wider range of associations and possibilities to be explored and increasing openness to experience. A decline in cognitive abilities, including creative processing and divergent thinking, is observed during the aging process. In particular, studies on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) show poorer performance in executive functions, including CF. The present paper suggests that psychedelic hallucinations induced by VR may help optimize the balance between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory information. Therefore, enhanced CF and creativity may be crucial during the aging process for maintaining cognitive functions and preventing pathological conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This PRISMA-compliant systematic review aims to comprehensively and transdiagnostically examine the differences in predictive coding between individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy controls. We included 72 articles including case-control studies investigating predictive coding as the primary outcome and reporting behavioral, neuroimaging, or electrophysiological findings. Thirty-three studies investigated predictive coding in the schizophrenia spectrum, 33 in neurodevelopmental disorders, 5 in mood disorders, 4 in neurocognitive disorders, 1 in post-traumatic stress disorder, and 1 in substance use disorders. Oddball and oddball-like paradigms were most frequently used to quantify predictive coding performance. Evidence showed heterogeneous impairments in the predictive coding abilities of the brain across neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly in schizophrenia and autism. Patients within the schizophrenia spectrum showed a consistent pattern of impaired non-social predictive coding. Conversely, predictive coding deficits were more selective for social cues in the autism spectrum. Predictive coding impairments were correlated with clinical symptom severity. These findings underscore the potential utility of predictive coding as a framework for understanding cognitive dysfunctions in the neuropsychiatric population, even though more evidence is needed on underexplored conditions, also considering potential confounders such as medication use and sex/gender. The potential role of predictive coding as a determinant of treatment response may also be considered to tailor personalized interventions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—a type of neurodevelopmental disorder—is increasing and is around 2\% in North America, Asia, and Europe. Besides the known genetic link, environmental, epigenetic, and metabolic factors have been implicated in ASD etiology. Although highly heterogeneous at the behavioral level, ASD comprises a set of core symptoms including impaired communication and social interaction skills as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. This has led to the suggestion that a large part of the ASD phenotype is caused by changes in a few and common set of signaling pathways, the identification of which is a fundamental aim of autism research. Using advanced bioinformatics tools and the abundantly available genetic data, it is possible to classify the large number of ASD-associated genes according to cellular function and pathways. Cellular processes known to be impaired in ASD include gene regulation, synaptic transmission affecting the excitation/inhibition balance, neuronal Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ signaling, development of short-/long-range connectivity (circuits and networks), and mitochondrial function. Such alterations often occur during early postnatal neurodevelopment. Among the neurons most affected in ASD as well as in schizophrenia are those expressing the Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These mainly inhibitory interneurons present in many different brain regions in humans and rodents are characterized by rapid, non-adaptive firing and have a high energy requirement. PV expression is often reduced at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human ASD brain samples and mouse ASD (and schizophrenia) models. Although the human {\textless}italic{\textgreater}PVALB{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene is not a high-ranking susceptibility/risk gene for either disorder and is currently only listed in the SFARI Gene Archive, we propose and present supporting evidence for the Parvalbumin Hypothesis, which posits that decreased PV level is causally related to the etiology of ASD (and possibly schizophrenia).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The cardinal pathological features of the disease have been known for more than one hundred years, and today the presence of these amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are still required for a pathological diagnosis. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia globally. There remain no effective treatment options for the great majority of patients, and the primary causes of the disease are unknown except in a small number of familial cases driven by genetic mutations. Confounding efforts to develop effective diagnostic tools and disease-modifying therapies is the realization that Alzheimer’s disease is a mixed proteinopathy (amyloid and tau) frequently associated with other age-related processes such as cerebrovascular disease and Lewy body disease. Defining the relationships between and interdependence of various co-pathologies remains an active area of investigation. This review outlines etiologically-linked pathologic features of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as those that are inevitable findings of uncertain significance, such as granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies. Other disease processes that are frequent, but not inevitable, are also discussed, including pathologic processes that can clinically mimic Alzheimer’s disease. These include cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, TDP-43 proteinopathies and argyrophilic grain disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of Alzheimer’s disease pathology, its defining pathologic substrates and the related pathologies that can affect diagnosis and treatment.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal MRI is a powerful tool that allows the assessment of progression of brain changes over multiple imaging time-points and has been increasingly employed in the study of neurodegenerative dementias, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Early studies demonstrated that AD was associated with increased rates of whole brain loss and hippocampal atrophy. A number of sophisticated voxel-level techniques have now been developed that have provided additional information describing regional atrophy over time in the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes in AD. Studies have also focused on subjects in the prodromal phase of AD in order to describe the earliest changes that are occurring in the brain. Atrophy has been shown to start in the medial temporal lobes and fusiform gyrus at least 3 years before subjects reach a diagnosis of AD, and then spread to the posterior temporal lobes and parietal lobes, and then eventually the frontal lobes. These patterns of atrophy correlate well with the progression of neurofibrillary tangles observed on pathology. Rates of atrophy have also been shown to accelerate over the course of the disease as a subject progresses from cognitively normal to a diagnosis of AD. Similar techniques have also been applied to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia which show higher rates of atrophy and different patterns of progression to those observed in AD. Hence, longitudinal MRI shows promise as a biomarker of disease progression in neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with marked brain atrophy. While commonly used structural MRI imaging methods do not account for the complexity of human brain morphology, little is known about the longitudinal changes of cortical geometry and their relationship with cognitive decline in subjects with AD.
Methods
Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to perform two-sample t-tests to investigate longitudinal changes of cortical thickness (CTh) and three surface-based morphometry measures: fractal dimension (i.e. cortical complexity; FD), gyrification index (GI), and sulcal depth (SD) in subjects with AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in comparison to cognitively unimpaired controls (CU) in baseline and 2-year follow-up sMRI scans. In addition, correlations of the morphological measures with two-year cognitive decline as assessed by the modified AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog 11) were calculated via regression analyses.
Results
Compared to CU, both AD and aMCI showed marked decreases in CTh. In contrast, analyses of FD and GI yielded a more nuanced decline of the respective measures with some areas showing increases in FD and GI. Overall changes in FD and GI were more pronounced in AD as compared to aMCI. Analyses of SD yielded widespread decreases. Interestingly, cognitive decline corresponded well with CTh declines in aMCI but not AD, whereas changes in FD corresponded with AD only but not aMCI, whereas GI and SD were associated with cognitive decline in aMCI and AD.
Conclusion
Patterns of longitudinal changes in FD, GI and SD were only partially overlapping with CTh reductions. In AD, surface-based morphometry measures for brain-surface complexity showed better correspondence than CTh with cognitive decline over a two-year period of time. Being drawn from measures reflecting changes in more intricate aspects of human brain morphology, these data provide new insight into the complexity of AD-related brain atrophy and its relationship with cognitive decline.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the leading cause of senile dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and exerting tremendous socioeconomic burden on all societies. Although definitive diagnosis of AD is often made in the presence of clinical manifestations in late stages, it is now universally believed that AD is a continuum of disease commencing from the preclinical stage with typical neuropathological alterations appearing decades prior to its first symptom, to the prodromal stage with slight symptoms of amnesia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI), and then to the terminal stage with extensive loss of basic cognitive functions, i.e., AD-dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers have been developed in a search to meet the increasing clinical need of early detection and treatment monitoring for AD, with reference to the pathophysiological targets in Alzheimer's brain. These include the pathological aggregations of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plagues and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), impaired neurotransmitter system, neuroinflammation, as well as deficient synaptic vesicles and glucose utilization. In this article we survey the various PET radiotracers available for AD imaging and discuss their clinical applications especially in terms of early detection and cognitive relevance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

METHODS: We examined the (18)F-FDG PET scans of 548 subjects, including 110 healthy elderly individuals ("normals" or NLs), 114 MCI, 199 AD, 98 FTD, and 27 DLB patients, collected at 7 participating centers. Individual PET scans were Z scored using automated voxel-based comparison with generation of disease-specific patterns of cortical and hippocampal (18)F-FDG uptake that were then applied to characterize MCI.
RESULTS: Standardized disease-specific PET patterns were developed that correctly classified 95\% AD, 92\% DLB, 94\% FTD, and 94\% NL. MCI patients showed primarily posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal hypometabolism (81\%), whereas neocortical abnormalities varied according to neuropsychological profiles. An AD PET pattern was observed in 79\% MCI with deficits in multiple cognitive domains and 31\% amnesic MCI. (18)F-FDG PET heterogeneity in MCI with nonmemory deficits ranged from absent hypometabolism to FTD and DLB PET patterns.
CONCLUSION: Standardized automated analysis of (18)F-FDG PET scans may provide an objective and sensitive support to the clinical diagnosis in early dementia.},

	abstract = {Generally, dementia should be considered an acquired syndrome, with multiple possible causes, rather than a specific disease in itself. The leading causes of dementia are neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative alterations. Nevertheless, the neurodegenerative group of diseases that lead to cognitive impairment and dementia includes multiple possibilities or mixed pathologies with personalized treatment management for each cause, even if Alzheimer’s disease is the most common pathology. Therefore, an accurate differential diagnosis is mandatory in order to select the most appropriate therapy approach. The role of personalized assessment in the treatment of dementia is rapidly growing. Neuroimaging is an essential tool for differential diagnosis of multiple causes of dementia and allows a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic protocol based on risk factors that may improve treatment management, especially in early diagnosis during the prodromal stage. The utility of structural and functional imaging could be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods and by the development of algorithms for automated assessment. The aim of this review is to focus on the most commonly used tracers for differential diagnosis in the dementia field. Particularly, we aim to explore 18F Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in Alzheimer’s disease and in other neurodegenerative causes of dementia.},

	abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a well-established imaging modality. Measurement of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMR(glc)) using PET and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard technique in both oncology and dementia research. When measuring rCMR(glc) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), characteristic reductions in rCMR(glc) are found in neocortical association areas including the posterior cingulate, precuneus, temporoparietal and frontal multimodal association regions; the primary visual cortex, sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum are relatively unaffected. FDG-PET has been used in the study of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to accurately predict the subsequent decline to AD. Impairment in rCMR(glc) may be seen in individuals at high genetic risk of AD, even before clinical symptoms are apparent. Characteristic patterns of regional hypometabolism are also seen in other degenerative dementias such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The use of different radioisotopes and tracers increases the versatility of PET. Tracers adopted in dementia research include (11)C-PK-11195 and (11)C-PIB, which have been used to investigate neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition, respectively, in both AD and MCI populations. It is also possible to investigate neurotransmitter systems in dementia; targets have included the cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. Imaging the brains of dementia patients using PET provides important information about the brain function of these individuals that would otherwise be unavailable with other imaging modalities. PET will continue to be important in future dementia research as new tracers become available to help in the early and specific diagnosis of increasingly well-defined clinical syndromes, and assist in the assessment of new therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Ordering of information is a critical component that underlies several cognitive functions. Prefrontal theta–gamma coupling (TGC) is a neurophysiologic measure associated with ordering of information during the performance of a working memory task (N-back). Little is known about the relationship between TGC and ordering during other cognitive tasks or whether the relationship between TGC and ordering of information is independent of clinical condition. This study aimed to determine whether the relationship between TGC and ordering of information exists independent of a task and its timing, and whether this relationship is the same in different clinical conditions. A total of 311 participants were assessed using a neuropsychological battery that included the N-back during which TGC was measured; two other tasks that also require ordering; and three tests that do not require ordering. All non-N-back tasks were completed several days separate from the N-back by a mean interval (SD) of 5.14 (8.03). Our three hypotheses were that TGC during the N-back task would be associated with performance on N-Back and other cognitive tasks that also require ordering, but not with performance on cognitive tasks that do not require ordering; and that these relationships will be independent of clinical diagnosis. Multivariate linear regression results show that TGC was associated with performance on the ordering tasks but not the non-ordering tasks. In addition, there was no interaction between TGC and diagnosis. Our study is the first to demonstrate that TGC is a neurophysiologic measure of ordering information across several cognitive tasks that require ordering, and this TGC-ordering relationship is stable over time even when several days separate the measurement of TGC and the performance of the ordering tasks. Our results also show that this relationship is independent of clinical diagnosis, supporting the brain–behavior nature of this relationship. These results highlight the importance of TGC in ordering-based cognition, and suggest that TGC could be a valid target for interventions that aim to enhance this function across cognitive tasks and clinical conditions.},

Here, we employed the recently-developed Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis to characterize such nonlinear amplitude modulation(s) (AM) underlying VWM in the frontoparietal systems. We found that the strength of AM in mid-frontal beta and gamma oscillations during late VWM maintenance and VWM retrieval correlated with people’s VWM performance. When behavioral performance was altered with transcranial electric stimulation, AM power changes during late VWM maintenance in beta, but not gamma, tracked participants’ VWM variations. This beta AM likely codes information by varying its amplitude in theta period for long-range propagation, as our connectivity analysis revealed that interareal theta-beta couplings—bidirectional between mid-frontal and right-parietal during VWM maintenance and unidirectional from right-parietal to left-middle-occipital during late VWM maintenance and retrieval—underpins VWM performance and individual differences.},

We found that stronger delta-beta coupling at parietal sites was associated with higher self-reported AC. However, no significant associations were found between executive control network functioning and the EEG ratio or coupling measures. Furthermore, a lower spontaneous fronto-parietal theta/beta ratio was found to be associated with better orienting network functioning.

This viewpoint allows us to apply many techniques developed for use in thermodynamics to the subject of algorithmic information theory. In particular, suppose we fix a universal prefix-free Turing machine and let X be the set of programs that halt for this machine. Then we can regard X as a set of 'microstates', and treat any function on X as an 'observable'. For any collection of observables, we can study the Gibbs ensemble that maximizes entropy subject to constraints on expected values of these observables. We illustrate this by taking the log runtime, length, and output of a program as observables analogous to the energy E, volume V and number of molecules N in a container of gas. The conjugate variables of these observables allow us to define quantities which we call the 'algorithmic temperature' T, 'algorithmic pressure' P and algorithmic potential' mu, since they are analogous to the temperature, pressure and chemical potential. We derive an analogue of the fundamental thermodynamic relation dE = T dS - P d V + mu dN, and use it to study thermodynamic cycles analogous to those for heat engines. We also investigate the values of T, P and mu for which the partition function converges. At some points on the boundary of this domain of convergence, the partition function becomes uncomputable. Indeed, at these points the partition function itself has nontrivial algorithmic entropy.},

The working group of the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative (SCD-I) addressed this deficiency by reaching consensus on terminology and on a conceptual framework for research on SCD in AD. In this publication, research criteria for SCD in pre-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are presented. In addition, a list of core features proposed for reporting in SCD studies is provided, which will enable comparability of research across different settings. Finally, a set of features is presented, which in accordance with current knowledge, increases the likelihood of the presence of preclinical AD in individuals with SCD.

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined “network motifs,” patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

In what follows, we suggest that {\textless}italic{\textgreater}value is evidence{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} or, more exactly, log Bayesian evidence. This implies that a sufficient explanation for valuable behavior is the accumulation of evidence for internal models of our world. This contrasts with normative models of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which assume the existence of a value function that explains behavior, where (somewhat tautologically) behavior maximizes value. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation—active inference—that replaces policies in normative models with prior beliefs about the (future) states agents should occupy. This enables optimal behavior to be cast purely in terms of inference: where agents sample their sensorium to maximize the evidence for their generative model of hidden states in the world, and minimize their uncertainty about those states. Crucially, this formulation resolves the tautology inherent in normative models and allows one to consider how prior beliefs are themselves optimized in a hierarchical setting. We illustrate these points by showing that any optimal policy can be specified with prior beliefs in the context of Bayesian inference. We then show how these prior beliefs are themselves prescribed by an imperative to minimize uncertainty. This formulation explains the saccadic eye movements required to read this text and defines the value of the visual sensations you are soliciting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These functions have been experimentally studied in selected systems, mostly Escherichia coli.Negative autoregulation can speed up responses and reduce fluctuations, whereas positive autoregulation slows responses and increases variations.Coherent feedforward loops can show persistence detection, whereas incoherent feedforward loops show pulse generation and response acceleration.Single-input modules can generate temporal programmes of expression.Dense overlapping regulons can act as arrays of gates for combinatorial decision making.Developmental networks display these network motifs, and additional motifs, such as two-point positive-feedforward loops for decision making and memory, and cascades for regulating slow multi-step processes.Network motifs in systems that have been studied experimentally so far seem to be wired together in a 'modular' way that allows us to understand the dynamics of each individual motif, even when it is connected to the rest of the network.Evolution seems to have converged on the same motifs in different systems and different organisms, suggesting that they are selected for again and again on the basis of their biological functions.Other biological networks, such as signalling and neuronal networks, also show network motifs, some of which are similar to the motifs that are found in transcription networks.},

In particular, we provide minimax optimal rates for kernel ridge regression on compact manifolds, with a target function that is invariant to a group action on the manifold. Our results hold for any smooth compact Lie group action, even groups of positive dimension. For a finite group, the gain effectively multiplies the number of samples by the group size. For groups of positive dimension, the gain is observed by a reduction in the manifold's dimension, in addition to a factor proportional to the volume of the quotient space. Our proof takes the viewpoint of differential geometry, in contrast to the more common strategy of using invariant polynomials. This new geometric viewpoint on learning with invariances may be of independent interest.},

	abstract = {The first part of the paper is devoted to a comparison between the functional architectures of the cerebral cortex and artificial intelligent systems. While the two systems share numerous features, natural systems differ in at least four important aspects: i) the prevalence of recurrent connections, ii) the ability to use the temporal domain for computations, iii) the ability to perform "in memory" computations and iv) the prevalence of analog computations. The second part of the paper focuses on a simulation study that has been designed to answer the long-standing question of whether the oscillatory patterning of neuronal activity, which is a hallmark of natural systems, is an epiphenomenon of recurrent interactions or serves a functional role. To this end, recurrent neuronal networks were simulated to capture essential features of cortical networks, and their performance was tested on standard pattern recognition benchmark tests. In order to control the oscillatory regime of these networks, its nodes were configured as damped harmonic oscillators. By varying the damping factor, the nodes functioned either as leaky integrators or oscillators. It turned out that networks with oscillatory nodes substantially outperformed their non-oscillating counterparts. The reasons for this superior performance and similarities with natural neuronal networks are discussed. It is concluded that the oscillatory patterning of neuronal responses is functionally relevant because it allows the exploitation of the unique dynamics of coupled oscillators for analog computation.},

	abstract = {Environmental temperature dictates the developmental pace of poikilothermic animals. In Drosophila, slower development at lower temperatures results in higher brain connectivity, but the generality of such scaling across temperatures and brain regions and its impact on function are unclear. Here, we show that brain connectivity scales continuously across temperatures, in agreement with a first-principle model that postulates different metabolic constraints for the growth of the brain and the organism. The model predicts brain wiring under temperature cycles and the nonuniform temporal scaling of neural development across temperatures. Developmental temperature has notable effects on odor-driven behavior. Dissecting the circuit architecture and function of neurons in the olfactory pathway, we demonstrate that developmental temperature does not alter odor encoding in first- and second-order neurons, but it shifts the specificity of connections onto third-order neurons that mediate innate behaviors. We conclude that while some circuit computations are robust to the effects of developmental temperature on wiring, others exhibit phenotypic plasticity with possible adaptive advantages.},

	abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which is linked to Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, preceding the disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.},

Here, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) were measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after treatment with psilocybin (serotonin agonist) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Quality pre and post treatment fMRI data were collected from 16 of 19 patients. Decreased depressive symptoms were observed in all 19 patients at 1-week post-treatment and 47\% met criteria for response at 5 weeks. Whole-brain analyses revealed post-treatment decreases in CBF in the temporal cortex, including the amygdala. Decreased amygdala CBF correlated with reduced depressive symptoms. Focusing on a priori selected circuitry for RSFC analyses, increased RSFC was observed within the default-mode network (DMN) post-treatment. Increased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-bilateral inferior lateral parietal cortex RSFC was predictive of treatment response at 5-weeks, as was decreased parahippocampal-prefrontal cortex RSFC. These data fill an important knowledge gap regarding the post-treatment brain effects of psilocybin, and are the first in depressed patients. The post-treatment brain changes are different to previously observed acute effects of psilocybin and other ‘psychedelics’ yet were related to clinical outcomes. A ‘reset’ therapeutic mechanism is proposed.},

	abstract = {With rapid technological advances, social media has become an everyday form of human social interactions. For the first time in evolutionary history, people can now interact in virtual spaces where temporal, spatial, and embodied cues are decoupled from one another. What implications do these recent changes have for socio-cognitive phenotypes and mental disorders? We have conducted a systematic review on the relationships between social media use and mental disorders involving the social brain. The main findings indicate evidence of increased social media usage in individuals with psychotic spectrum phenotypes and especially among individuals with disorders characterized by alterations in the basic self, most notably narcissism, body dysmorphism, and eating disorders. These findings can be understood in the context of a new conceptual model, referred to here as ‘Delusion Amplification by Social Media’, whereby this suite of disorders and symptoms centrally involves forms of mentalistic delusions, linked with altered perception and perpetuation of distorted manifestations of the self, that are enabled and exacerbated by social media. In particular, an underdeveloped and incoherent sense of self, in conjunction with ‘real life’ social isolation that inhibits identify formation and facilitates virtual social interactions, may lead to use of social media to generate and maintain a more or less delusional sense of self identity. The delusions involved may be mental (as in narcissism and erotomania), or somatic (as in body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorders, encompassing either the entire body or specific body parts). In each case, the virtual nature of social media facilitates the delusionality because the self is defined and bolstered in this highly mentalistic environment, where real-life exposure of the delusion can be largely avoided. Current evidence also suggests that increased social media usage, via its disembodied and isolative nature, may be associated with psychotic spectrum phenotypes, especially delusionality, by the decoupling of inter and intra-corporeal cues integral to shared reality testing, leading to the blurring of self-other boundaries.},

We analyzed a multimodal dataset collected through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and polysomnographic recording from 72 older adults. A proxy of the glymphatic functioning was obtained from the Diffusion Tensor Image Analysis along the Perivascular Space (DTI-ALPS) index. Structural and functional brain networks were constructed based on MRI data, and coupling between the two networks (SC-FC coupling) was also calculated. Correlation analyses revealed that DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with sleep quality measures [e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and apnea-hypopnea index]. Regarding human brain networks, DTI-ALPS was associated with the strength of both functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) involving regions such as the middle temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as with the SC-FC coupling of rich-club connections. Furthermore, we found that DTI-ALPS positively mediated the association between sleep quality and rich-club SC-FC coupling. The rich-club SC-FC coupling further mediated the association between DTI-ALPS and memory function in good sleepers but not in poor sleepers. The results suggest a disrupted glymphatic-brain relationship in poor sleepers, which underlies memory decline. Our findings add important evidence that sleep quality affects cognitive health through the underlying neural relationships and the interplay between the glymphatic system and multimodal brain networks.},

Simultaneous recordings from V1 and downstream area V4 confirmed that γ- and α-waves propagate in the feedforward and feedback direction, respectively. Microstimulation in V1 elicited γ-oscillations in V4, whereas microstimulation in V4 elicited α-oscillations in V1, thus providing causal evidence for the opposite propagation of these rhythms. Furthermore, blocking NMDA receptors, thought to be involved in feedback processing, suppressed α while boosting γ.

	abstract = {Blood perfusion delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells, making it a fundamental feature of brain organization. How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1 305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5–100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows microarchitectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.},

	abstract = {Interneurons exhibiting centre--surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly's compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron's dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow \& Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965).},

In particular, we extend current formulations of the brain as an organ of inference--based upon hierarchical predictive coding--and consider how these inferences are orchestrated. In other words, what would the brain require to dynamically coordinate and contextualize its message passing to optimize its computational goals? The answer that emerges rests on the delicate (modulatory) gain control of neuronal populations that select and coordinate (prediction error) signals that ascend cortical hierarchies. This is important because it speaks to a hierarchical anatomy of extrinsic (between region) connections that form two distinct classes, namely a class of driving (first-order) connections that are concerned with encoding the content of neuronal representations and a class of modulatory (second-order) connections that establish context-in the form of the salience or precision ascribed to content. We explore the implications of this distinction from a formal perspective (using simulations of feature-ground segregation) and consider the neurobiological substrates of the ensuing precision-engineered dynamics, with a special focus on the pulvinar and attention.},

Now it is time to understand how the many active neuronal groups interact with each other and how their communication is flexibly modulated to bring about our cognitive dynamics. I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times. Thus, a flexible pattern of coherence defines a flexible communication structure, which subserves our cognitive flexibility.},

	abstract = {Selective attention implements preferential routing of attended stimuli, likely through increasing the influence of the respective synaptic inputs on higher-area neurons. As the inputs of competing stimuli converge onto postsynaptic neurons, presynaptic circuits might offer the best target for attentional top-down influences. If those influences enabled presynaptic circuits to selectively entrain postsynaptic neurons, this might explain selective routing. Indeed, when two visual stimuli induce two gamma rhythms in V1, only the gamma induced by the attended stimulus entrains gamma in V4. Here, we modelled induced responses with a Dynamic Causal Model for Cross-Spectral Densities and found that selective entrainment can be explained by attentional modulation of intrinsic V1 connections. Specifically, local inhibition was decreased in the granular input layer and increased in the supragranular output layer of the V1 circuit that processed the attended stimulus. Thus, presynaptic attentional influences and ensuing entrainment were sufficient to mediate selective routing.},

	abstract = {Interoception, the perception of internal visceral states, arises from complex brain-body interactions across the central and peripheral nervous systems. Despite noradrenaline's key role in these interactions, its specific contribution to interoceptive processes remains unclear. In a placebo-controlled, randomised, within-subject study, we employed computational modelling of interoceptive psychophysics to determine how pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor antagonism controls interoception across cardiac and respiratory domains. Both cardio-selective bisoprolol and non-selective propranolol improved cardiac perceptual sensitivity, with bisoprolol exerting an enhanced effect on cardiac metacognition. In contrast, both beta-blockers increased respiratory perceptual precision, with no corresponding changes in sensitivity or metacognition. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between central and peripheral beta-adrenergic mechanisms in interoception, highlighting the pivotal role of peripheral noradrenaline in regulating multi-organ brain-body interactions. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may provide promising routes for modulating distinct facets of interoception, potentially opening new avenues for intervention in conditions characterised by disrupted bodily self-awareness.},

	abstract = {Investigating the dynamics of neural networks, which are governed by connectivity between neurons, is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Perturbation-based approaches allow the precise estimation of neural dynamic models and have been extensively applied in studies of brain functions and neural state transitions. However, the question of how optimal perturbations which most effectively identify dynamical models in neuroscience should be designed remains unclear. To address this, we propose a novel theoretical framework for estimating optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in linear time-invariant systems. The model represents neural dynamics using a connectivity matrix and an input matrix. Our framework derives an objective function to optimize perturbation inputs, which minimizes estimation errors in the model matrices. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this function with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We then outline an iterative approach to perturbation input design. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating perturbation inputs significantly improves system identification accuracy as dictated by the objective function. Moreover, perturbation inputs tuned to a parameter related to the eigenvalues and a network structure of the intrinsic model enhance system identification. Through this iterative approach, the estimated model matrix gradually approaches the true matrix. As an application, we confirmed that the framework also contributes to the optimal control theory. This study highlights the potential of designing perturbation inputs to achieve the advanced identification of neural dynamics. By providing a framework for optimizing perturbations, our work facilitates deeper insights into brain functions and advances in the study of complex neural systems.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Predictive coding theories of sensory brain function interpret the hierarchical construction of the cerebral cortex as a Bayesian, generative model capable of predicting the sensory data consistent with any given percept. Predictions are fed backward in the hierarchy and reciprocated by prediction error in the forward direction, acting to modify the representation of the outside world at increasing levels of abstraction, and so to optimize the nature of perception over a series of iterations. This accounts for many ‘illusory’ instances of perception where what is seen (heard, etc.) is unduly influenced by what is expected, based on past experience. This simple conception, the hierarchical exchange of prediction and prediction error, confronts a rich cortical microcircuitry that is yet to be fully documented. This article presents the view that, in the current state of theory and practice, it is profitable to begin a two-way exchange: that predictive coding theory can support an understanding of cortical microcircuit function, and prompt particular aspects of future investigation, whilst existing knowledge of microcircuitry can, in return, influence theoretical development. As an example, a neural inference arising from the earliest formulations of predictive coding is that the source populations of forward and backward pathways should be completely separate, given their functional distinction; this aspect of circuitry – that neurons with extrinsically bifurcating axons do not project in both directions – has only recently been confirmed. Here, the computational architecture prescribed by a generalized (free-energy) formulation of predictive coding is combined with the classic ‘canonical microcircuit’ and the laminar architecture of hierarchical extrinsic connectivity to produce a template schematic, that is further examined in the light of (a) updates in the microcircuitry of primate visual cortex, and (b) rapid technical advances made possible by transgenic neural engineering in the mouse. The exercise highlights a number of recurring themes, amongst them the consideration of interneuron diversity as a spur to theoretical development and the potential for specifying a pyramidal neuron’s function by its individual ‘connectome,’ combining its extrinsic projection (forward, backward or subcortical) with evaluation of its intrinsic network (e.g., unidirectional versus bidirectional connections with other pyramidal neurons).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our results allow us to infer that increasing contrast increases the sensitivity or gain of superficial pyramidal cells to inputs from spiny stellate populations. Furthermore, changes in the effective spatial extent of horizontal coupling nuance the spatiotemporal filtering properties of cortical laminae in V1 - effectively preserving higher spatial frequencies. These results are consistent with recent non-invasive human studies of contrast dependent changes in the gain of pyramidal cells elaborating forward connections - studies designed to test specific hypotheses about precision and gain control based on predictive coding. Furthermore, they are consistent with established results showing that the receptive fields of V1 units shrink with increasing visual contrast.},

This approach exploits inter-subject variability and trial-specific effects associated with modulations in the peak frequency of gamma oscillations. Neural field models are used to evaluate model evidence and obtain parameter estimates using invasive and non-invasive gamma recordings. Our overview comprises two parts: in the first part, we use neural fields to simulate neural activity and distinguish the effects of post synaptic filtering on predicted responses in terms of synaptic rate constants that correspond to different timescales and distinct neurotransmitters. We focus on model predictions of conductance and convolution based field models and show that these can yield spectral responses that are sensitive to biophysical properties of local cortical circuits like synaptic kinetics and filtering; we also consider two different mechanisms for this filtering: a nonlinear mechanism involving specific conductances and a linear convolution of afferent firing rates producing post synaptic potentials. In the second part of this paper, we use neural fields quantitatively—to fit empirical data recorded during visual stimulation. We present two studies of spectral responses obtained from the visual cortex during visual perception experiments: in the first study, MEG data were acquired during a task designed to show how activity in the gamma band is related to visual perception, while in the second study, we exploited high density electrocorticographic (ECoG) data to study the effect of varying stimulus contrast on cortical excitability and gamma peak frequency.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The oxidative stress hypothesis of AD pathogenesis, in part, is based on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Oxidative modification of the protein may induce structural changes in a protein that might lead to its functional impairment. A number of oxidatively modified brain proteins were identified using redox proteomics in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Abeta models of AD, which support a role of Abeta in the alteration of a number of biochemical and cellular processes such as energy metabolism, protein degradation, synaptic function, neuritic growth, neurotransmission, cellular defense system, long term potentiation involved in formation of memory, etc. All the redox proteomics-identified brain proteins fit well with the appearance of the three histopathological hallmarks of AD, i.e., synapse loss, amyloid plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangle formation and suggest a direct or indirect association of the identified proteins with the pathological and/or biochemical alterations in AD. Further, Abeta models of AD strongly support the notion that oxidative stress induced by Abeta may be a driving force in AD pathogenesis. Studies conducted on arguably the earliest stage of AD, MCI, may elucidate the mechanism(s) leading to AD pathogenesis by identifying early markers of the disease, and to develop therapeutic strategies to slow or prevent the progression of AD. In this review, we summarized our findings of redox proteomics identified oxidatively modified proteins in AD, MCI and AD models.},

Mitochondrial morphology changes rapidly in response to external insults and changes in metabolic status via fission and fusion processes (so-called mitochondrial dynamics) that maintain mitochondrial quality and homeostasis. Damaged mitochondria are removed by a process known as mitophagy, which involves their degradation by a specific autophagosomal pathway. Over the last few years, remarkable efforts have been made to investigate the impact on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) of various forms of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ dyshomeostasis, loss of ATP, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics and transport, and mitophagy. Recent research suggests that restoration of mitochondrial function by physical exercise, an antioxidant diet, or therapeutic approaches can delay the onset and slow the progression of AD.

Aβ disrupts glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA receptors, which mediates calcium dyshomeostasis and damages synapse plasticity characterized by long-term potentiation (LTP) suppression and long-term depression (LTD) enhancement. As Aβ stimulates and Ca2+ influx, microglial cells and astrocyte can be activated and release cytokines, which reduces glutamate uptake and further impair synapse function. Besides, extracellular glutamate accumulation induced by Aβ mediates synapse toxicity resulting from reduced glutamate receptors and glutamate spillovers. Aβ also mediates synaptic dysfunction by acting on various signaling pathways and molecular targets, disrupting mitochondria and energy metabolism. In addition, Aβ overdeposition aggravates the toxic damage of hyperphosphorylated tau to synapses. Synaptic dysfunction plays a critical role in cognitive impairment of AD.

These trials also show that inhibiting Aβ neurotoxicity leads to a reduction in tau pathology, suggesting a pathogenic sequence of events where amyloid toxicity drives an increase in tau formation and deposition. The late-stage agents with positive clinical or biomarker data include four antibodies that engage Aβ oligomers (aducanumab, lecanemab, gantenerumab, and donanemab) and ALZ-801, an oral agent that fully blocks the formation of Aβ oligomers at the clinical dose.},

With no cure available, limited treatments mostly focus on symptom management. Identifying early changes in the disease course may provide new therapeutic targets to halt or reverse disease progression. Clinical studies have shown that cortical and hippocampal hyperactivity are a feature shared by patients in the early stages of disease, progressing to hypoactivity during later stages of neurodegeneration. The exact mechanisms causing neuronal excitability changes are not fully characterized; however, animal and cell models have provided insights into some of the factors involved in this phenotype. In this review, we summarize the evidence for neuronal excitability changes over the course of AD onset and progression and the molecular mechanisms underpinning these differences. Specifically, we discuss contributors to aberrant neuronal excitability, including abnormal levels of intracellular Ca2+ and glutamate, pathological amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, genetic risk factors, including APOE, and impaired inhibitory interneuron and glial function. In light of recent research indicating hyperexcitability could be a predictive marker of cognitive dysfunction, we further argue that the hyperexcitability phenotype could be leveraged to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AD, and present potential targets for future AD treatment development.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Accumulating evidence supports that physical exercise (EX) is the most effective non-pharmacological strategy to improve brain health. EX prevents cognitive decline associated with age and decreases the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. These positive effects of EX can be attributed to an increase in neurogenesis and neuroplastic processes, leading to learning and memory improvement. At the molecular level, there is a solid consensus to involve the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as the crucial molecule for positive EX effects on the brain. However, even though EX incontestably leads to beneficial processes through BDNF expression, cellular sources and molecular mechanisms underlying EX-induced cerebral BDNF overproduction are still being elucidated. In this context, the present review offers a summary of the different molecular mechanisms involved in brain’s response to EX, with a specific focus on BDNF. It aims to provide a cohesive overview of the three main mechanisms leading to EX-induced brain BDNF production: the neuronal-dependent overexpression, the elevation of cerebral blood flow (hemodynamic hypothesis), and the exerkine signaling emanating from peripheral tissues (humoral response). By shedding light on these intricate pathways, this review seeks to contribute to the ongoing elucidation of the relationship between EX and cerebral BDNF expression, offering valuable insights into the potential therapeutic implications for brain health enhancement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the cellular underpinnings of regional vulnerability are poorly understood, in part because whole-brain maps of a comprehensive collection of cell types have been inaccessible. Here, we deployed a recent cell-type mapping pipeline, Matrix Inversion and Subset Selection (MISS), to determine the brain-wide distributions of pan-hippocampal and neocortical cells in the mouse, and then used these maps to identify general principles of cell-type-based selective vulnerability in PS19 mouse models. We found that hippocampal glutamatergic neurons as a whole were significantly positively associated with regional tau deposition, suggesting vulnerability, while cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were negatively associated. We also identified oligodendrocytes as the single-most strongly negatively associated cell type. Further, cell-type distributions were more predictive of end-time-point tau pathology than AD-risk-gene expression. Using gene ontology analysis, we found that the genes that are directly correlated to tau pathology are functionally distinct from those that constitutively embody the vulnerable cells. In short, we have elucidated cell-type correlates of tau deposition across mouse models of tauopathy, advancing our understanding of selective cellular vulnerability at a whole-brain level.},

Popular examples of anomalous generalization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the success of overparametrization. We argue that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality.},

For example, we show that it is possible to compress 60,000 MNIST training images into just 10 synthetic distilled images (one per class) and achieve close to original performance with only a few gradient descent steps, given a fixed network initialization. We evaluate our method in various initialization settings and with different learning objectives.

We used ionizable lipid nanoparticles supplemented with biodegradable cationic polymers to enhance the transfection efficiency and delivery of messenger RNA encoding the damage-suppressor protein into buccal and rectal tissues. In mice with orthotopic oral cancer, messenger RNA-based radioprotection of normal tissue preserved the efficacy of radiation therapy.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with continuum of disease progression of increasing severity from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and lastly to AD. The transition from MCI to AD has been linked to brain hypersynchronization, but the underlying mechanisms leading to this are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that excessive excitation in AD disease progression would shift brain dynamics toward supercriticality across an extended regime of critical-like dynamics. In this framework, healthy brain activity during aging preserves operation at near the critical phase transition at balanced excitation–inhibition (E/I). To test this hypothesis, we used source-reconstructed resting-state MEG data from a cross-sectional cohort (N = 343) of individuals with SCD, MCI, and healthy controls (HC) as well as from a longitudinal cohort (N = 45) of MCI patients. We then assessed brain criticality by quantifying long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) and functional EI (fE/I) of neuronal oscillations. LRTCs were attenuated in SCD in spectrally and anatomically constrained regions while this breakdown was progressively more widespread in MC. In parallel, fE/I was increased in the MCI but not in the SC cohort. Both observations also predicted the disease progression in the longitudinal cohort. Finally, using machine learning trained on functional (LRTCs, fE/I) and structural (MTL volumes) features, we show that LRTCs and f/EI are the most informative features for accurate classification of individuals with SCD while structural changes accurate classify the individuals with MCI. These findings establish that a shift toward supercritical brain dynamics reflects early AD disease progression.},

Under ideal conditions-homogeneity in relevant network parameters and all-to-all connectivity, for instance-this mechanism can yield perfect synchronization. We find that approximate, imperfect synchronization is possible even with very sparse, random connectivity. The crucial quantity is the expected number of inputs per cell. As long as it is large enough (more precisely, as long as the variance of the total number of synaptic inputs per cell is small enough), tight synchronization is possible. The desynchronizing effect of random connectivity can be reduced by strengthening the E --{\textgreater} I synapses. More surprising, it cannot be reduced by strengthening the I --{\textgreater} E synapses. However, the decay time constant of inhibition plays an important role. Faster decay yields tighter synchrony. In particular, in models in which the inhibitory synapses are assumed to be instantaneous, the effects of sparse, random connectivity cannot be seen.},

Using this treatment in animal models, we are now beginning to understand the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level changes that underlie improvements in disease pathology, cognition, and behavior. A mechanistic understanding of the basic biology that underlies the 40-hertz treatment will inform ongoing clinical trials that offer a promising avenue of treatment without the side effects and high costs typically associated with pharmacological interventions.

We performed analysis at the scalp and source-space levels while participants listened to standard and deviant tone sequences. Through task instructions, we manipulated top-down expectation by presenting expected and unexpected deviant sequences. Children with ASD showed reduced superior frontal cortex (FC) responses to unexpected events but increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation to expected events. In contrast, children with ADHD exhibited reduced cortical responses in superior FC to expected events but strong PFC activation to unexpected events. Moreover, neural abnormalities were associated with specific control mechanisms, namely, inhibitory control in ASD and set-shifting in ADHD. Based on the predictive coding account, top-down expectation abnormalities could be attributed to a disproportionate reliance (precision) allocated to prior beliefs in ASD and to sensory input in ADHD.},

To address this, we study a marmoset model of ASD induced by valproic acid (VPA) treatment. We record high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) during an auditory task with two layers of temporal control, and applied a quantitative model to quantify the integrity of predictive coding across two distinct hierarchies. Our results demonstrate a persistent pattern of sensory hypersensitivity and unstable predictions across two brain hierarchies in VPA-treated animals, and reveal the associated spatio-spectro-temporal neural signatures. Despite the regular occurrence of imprecise predictions in VPA-treated animals, we observe diverse configurations of underestimation or overestimation of sensory regularities within the hierarchies. Our results demonstrate the coexistence of the two primary Bayesian accounts of ASD: overly-precise sensory observations and weak prior beliefs, and offer a potential multi-layered biomarker for ASD, which could enhance our understanding of its diverse symptoms.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Current diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia place emphasis on delusions and hallucinations, whereas the classical descriptions of schizophrenia by Kraepelin and Bleuler emphasized disorganization and impoverishment of mental activity. Despite the availability of antipsychotic medication for treating delusions and hallucinations, many patients continue to experience persisting disability. Improving treatment requires a better understanding of the processes leading to persisting disability. We recently introduced the term classical schizophrenia to describe cases with disorganized and impoverished mental activity, cognitive impairment and predisposition to persisting disability. Recent evidence reveals that a polygenic score indicating risk for schizophrenia predicts severity of the features of classical schizophrenia: disorganization, and to a lesser extent, impoverishment of mental activity and cognitive impairment. Current understanding of brain function attributes a cardinal role to predictive coding: the process of generating models of the world that are successively updated in light of confirmation or contradiction by subsequent sensory information. It has been proposed that abnormalities of these predictive processes account for delusions and hallucinations. Here we examine the evidence provided by electrophysiology and fMRI indicating that imprecise predictive coding is the core pathological process in classical schizophrenia, accounting for disorganization, psychomotor poverty and cognitive impairment. Functional imaging reveals aberrant brain activity at network hubs engaged during encoding of predictions. We discuss the possibility that frequent prediction errors might promote excess release of the neurotransmitter, dopamine, thereby accounting for the occurrence of episodes of florid psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations in classical schizophrenia. While the predictive coding hypotheses partially accounts for the time-course of classical schizophrenia, the overall body of evidence indicates that environmental factors also contribute. We discuss the evidence that chronic inflammation is a mechanism that might link diverse genetic and environmental etiological factors, and contribute to the proposed imprecision of predictive coding.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Top-down predictions are compared with bottom-up sensory data, and mismatches evoke prediction errors. In PC, the prediction errors are encoded in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of sensory cortex that feed forward. The PC model has been tested with multiple recording modalities using the global–local oddball paradigm. Consistent with PC, neuroimaging studies reported prediction error responses in sensory and higher-order areas. However, recent studies of neuronal spiking suggest that genuine prediction errors emerge in prefrontal cortex (PFC). This implies that predictive processing is a more cognitive than sensory-based mechanism – an observation that challenges PC and better aligns with a framework we call predictive routing (PR).},

Pain experiences have a high degree of variability depending on their context and prior anticipation. Viewing pain perception as a perceptual inference problem, we propose a predictive coding paradigm to characterize evoked and non-evoked pain. We record the local field potentials (LFPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of freely behaving rats-two regions known to encode the sensory-discriminative and affective-emotional aspects of pain, respectively. We further use predictive coding to investigate the temporal coordination of oscillatory activity between the S1 and ACC. Specifically, we develop a phenomenological predictive coding model to describe the macroscopic dynamics of bottom-up and top-down activity. Supported by recent experimental data, we also develop a biophysical neural mass model to describe the mesoscopic neural dynamics in the S1 and ACC populations, in both naive and chronic pain-treated animals. Our proposed predictive coding models not only replicate important experimental findings, but also provide new prediction about the impact of the model parameters on the physiological or behavioral read-out-thereby yielding mechanistic insight into the uncertainty of expectation, placebo or nocebo effect, and chronic pain.},

However, a detailed neuronal model of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the MMN is still lacking, and its computational foundations remain debated. We propose here a detailed neuronal model of auditory cortex, based on predictive coding, that accounts for the critical features of MMN. The model is entirely composed of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons interconnected in a layered cortical architecture with distinct input, predictive, and prediction error units. A spike-timing dependent learning rule, relying upon NMDA receptor synaptic transmission, allows the network to adjust its internal predictions and use a memory of the recent past inputs to anticipate on future stimuli based on transition statistics. We demonstrate that this simple architecture can account for the major empirical properties of the MMN. These include a frequency-dependent response to rare deviants, a response to unexpected repeats in alternating sequences (ABABAA…), a lack of consideration of the global sequence context, a response to sound omission, and a sensitivity of the MMN to NMDA receptor antagonists. Novel predictions are presented, and a new magnetoencephalography experiment in healthy human subjects is presented that validates our key hypothesis: the MMN results from active cortical prediction rather than passive synaptic habituation.},

A dataset of 862 sentences, extracted from 422 open subjective reports, was recently compiled as part of the Dreamachine programme (Collective Act, 2022), an immersive multisensory experience that combines SLS and spatial sound in a collective setting. Although open reports extend the range of reportable phenomenology, their analysis presents significant challenges, particularly in systematically identifying patterns. To address this challenge, we implemented a data-driven approach leveraging Large Language Models and Topic Modelling to uncover and interpret latent experiential topics directly from the Dreamachine's text-based reports. Our analysis confirmed the presence of simple VHs typically documented in scientific studies of SLS, while also revealing experiences of altered states of consciousness and complex hallucinations. Building on these findings, our computational approach expands the systematic study of subjective experience by enabling data-driven analyses of open-ended phenomenological reports, capturing experiences not readily identified through standard questionnaires. By revealing rich and multifaceted aspects of experiences, our study broadens our understanding of stroboscopically-induced phenomena while highlighting the potential of Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models in the emerging field of computational (neuro)phenomenology. More generally, this approach provides a practically applicable methodology for uncovering subtle hidden patterns of subjective experience across diverse research domains.},

	abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

Here, we introduce a non-invasive method to decode the production of sentences from brain activity and demonstrate its efficacy in a cohort of 35 healthy volunteers. For this, we present Brain2Qwerty, a new deep learning architecture trained to decode sentences from either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG), while participants typed briefly memorized sentences on a QWERTY keyboard. With MEG, Brain2Qwerty reaches, on average, a character-error-rate (CER) of 32\% and substantially outperforms EEG (CER: 67\%). For the best participants, the model achieves a CER of 19\%, and can perfectly decode a variety of sentences outside of the training set. While error analyses suggest that decoding depends on motor processes, the analysis of typographical errors suggests that it also involves higher-level cognitive factors. Overall, these results narrow the gap between invasive and non-invasive methods and thus open the path for developing safe brain-computer interfaces for non-communicating patients.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Consistent Reasoning Paradox (CRP). Consistent reasoning, which lies at the core of human intelligence, is the ability to handle tasks that are equivalent, yet described by different sentences ('Tell me the time!' and 'What is the time?'). The CRP asserts that consistent reasoning implies fallibility -- in particular, human-like intelligence in AI necessarily comes with human-like fallibility. Specifically, it states that there are problems, e.g. in basic arithmetic, where any AI that always answers and strives to mimic human intelligence by reasoning consistently will hallucinate (produce wrong, yet plausible answers) infinitely often. The paradox is that there exists a non-consistently reasoning AI (which therefore cannot be on the level of human intelligence) that will be correct on the same set of problems. The CRP also shows that detecting these hallucinations, even in a probabilistic sense, is strictly harder than solving the original problems, and that there are problems that an AI may answer correctly, but it cannot provide a correct logical explanation for how it arrived at the answer. Therefore, the CRP implies that any trustworthy AI (i.e., an AI that never answers incorrectly) that also reasons consistently must be able to say 'I don't know'. Moreover, this can only be done by implicitly computing a new concept that we introduce, termed the 'I don't know' function -- something currently lacking in modern AI. In view of these insights, the CRP also provides a glimpse into the behaviour of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). An AGI cannot be 'almost sure', nor can it always explain itself, and therefore to be trustworthy it must be able to say 'I don't know'.},

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus1, but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.},

For example, Beck’s theory highlights hopelessness, while the interpersonal–psychological theory of suicide emphasizes burdensomeness, lack of belonging and fearlessness about death. Surprisingly, few studies have tested which theoretically proposed psychological factors are most predictive of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We used network outcome analysis to disentangle the effects of these constructs in predicting suicidal ideation, suicide plans and attempts. Participants were 1,412 patients presenting to an emergency department with psychiatric complaints, with follow-up assessments one month and six months (n = 938) later. Here we showed that different psychological factors predicted different parts of the continuum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Lack of belongingness was most predictive of suicidal ideation (partial correlation (pcor) = 0.14), acquired capability for death (that is, fearlessness of death) was most predictive of suicide planning (pcor = 0.08), and hopelessness was most predictive of suicide attempts (pcor = 0.12). Individuals’ explicit associations with death (that is, death = me) prospectively predicted all three outcomes (pcor = 0.13–0.23). The occurrence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors is best predicted using constructs from several different theories of suicide.

Challenging the prevailing notion that emphasizes learning and plasticity as primary drivers of circuit assembly, in this Perspective, we delineate a tripartite framework to clarify the respective roles that learning and plasticity might have in this process. In the first part of the framework, which we term System One, neural circuits are established purely through genetically driven algorithms, in which spike timing-dependent plasticity serves no instructive role. We propose that these circuits equip the animal with sufficient skill and knowledge to successfully engage the world. Next, System Two is governed by rare but critical ‘single-shot learning’ events, which occur in response to survival situations and prompt rapid synaptic reconfiguration. Such events serve as crucial updates to the existing hardwired knowledge base of an organism. Finally, System Three is characterized by a perpetual state of synaptic recalibration, involving continual plasticity for circuit stabilization and fine-tuning. By outlining the definitions and roles of these three core systems, our framework aims to resolve existing ambiguities related to and enrich our understanding of neural circuit formation.},

Large-scale brain models, constrained by neuroimaging data, aim to trace the principles underlying such macroscopic neural activity from the intricate and multi-scale structure of the brain. Despite substantial progress in the field, many aspects about the mechanisms behind the onset of spatiotemporal neural dynamics are still unknown. In this work we establish a simple framework for the emergence of complex brain dynamics, including high-dimensional chaos and travelling waves. The model consists of a complex network of 90 brain regions, whose structural connectivity is obtained from tractography data. The activity of each brain area is governed by a Jansen neural mass model and we normalize the total input received by each node so it amounts the same across all brain areas. This assumption allows for the existence of an homogeneous invariant manifold, i.e., a set of different stationary and oscillatory states in which all nodes behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous solutions unveils a transverse instability of the synchronized state, which gives rise to different types of spatiotemporal dynamics, such as chaotic alpha activity. Additionally, we illustrate the ubiquity of this route towards complex spatiotemporal activity in a network of next generation neural mass models. Altogehter, our results unveil the bifurcation landscape that underlies the emergence of function from structure in the brain.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on high-frequency (gamma band) EEG activity, the most characteristic electrophysiological pattern in focal seizures of human epilepsy. It starts with recent hypotheses about: (i) the behaviour of inhibitory interneurons in hippocampal or neocortical networks in the generation of gamma frequency oscillations; (ii) the nonuniform alteration of GABAergic inhibition in experimental epilepsy (reduced dendritic inhibition and increased somatic inhibition); and (iii) the possible depression of GABA(A,fast) circuit activity by GABA(A,slow) inhibitory postsynaptic currents. In particular, these hypotheses are introduced in a new computational macroscopic model of EEG activity that includes a physiologically relevant fast inhibitory feedback loop. Results show that strikingly realistic activity is produced by the model when compared to real EEG signals recorded with intracerebral electrodes. They show that, in the model, the transition from interictal to fast ictal activity is explained by the impairment of dendritic inhibition.},

This frequency range covers the EEG bands beta 1 (12-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz). The pharmacological profile of both spontaneous and sensory-evoked EEG potentials reveals a very strong influence on these rhythms by drugs which have direct effects on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (general anaesthetics, sedative/hypnotics) or indirect effects on inhibitory neuronal function (opiates, ketamine). In addition, a number of experimental models of, in particular, gamma-frequency oscillations, have revealed both common denominators for oscillation generation and function, and subtle differences in network dynamics between the different frequency ranges. Powerful computer and mathematical modelling techniques based around both clinical and experimental observations have recently provided invaluable insight into the behaviour of large networks of interconnected neurons. In particular, the mechanistic profile of oscillations generated as an emergent property of such networks, and the mathematical derivation of this complex phenomenon have much to contribute to our understanding of how and why neurons oscillate. This review will provide the reader with a brief outline of the basic properties of inhibition-based oscillations in the CNS by combining research from laboratory models, large-scale neuronal network simulations, and mathematical analysis.},

To investigate whether these modulations could be considered as manifestations of the same underlying mechanism, we developed a neural mass model. The model provides five out of the theoretically proposed six different coupling types. Within model components, slow and fast activity engage in phase-frequency coupling in conditions of low ambient noise level and with high noise level engage in phase-amplitude coupling. Between model components, these couplings can be coordinated via slow activity, giving rise to more complex modulations. The model, thus, provides a coherent account of cross-frequency coupling, both within and between components, with which regional and cross-regional frequency and amplitude modulations could be addressed.},

We study phase–amplitude coupling as recorded at individual sites, using a modified version of the well-known Wendling neural mass model. To the population of fast inhibitory interneurons of this model, we added external modulatory input and dynamic self-feedback. These two modifications together are sufficient to let the inhibitory population serve as a limit-cycle oscillator, with frequency characteristics comparable to the beta and gamma bands. The frequency and power of these oscillations can be tuned through the time constant of the dynamic and modulatory input. Alpha band activity is generated, as is usual in such models, as a result of interactions of pyramidal neurons and a population of slow inhibitory interneurons. The slow inhibitory population activity directly influences the fast oscillations via the synaptic gain between slow and fast inhibitory populations. As a result, the amplitude envelope of the fast oscillation is coupled to the phase of the slow activity; this result is consistent with the notion that phase–amplitude coupling is effectuated by interactions between inhibitory interneurons.},

Alpha oscillations covary with changes in visual processing and have been associated with a broad range of neurocognitive functions. In this article, we review these associations and suggest that alpha oscillations can be thought to exhibit at least five distinct 'characters': those of the inhibitor, perceiver, predictor, communicator and stabiliser. In short, while alpha oscillations are strongly associated with reductions in visual attention, they also appear to play important roles in regulating the timing and temporal resolution of perception. Furthermore, alpha oscillations are strongly associated with top-down control and may facilitate transmission of predictions to visual cortex. This is in addition to promoting communication between frontal and posterior brain regions more generally, as well as maintaining ongoing perceptual states. We discuss why alpha oscillations might associate with such a broad range of cognitive functions and suggest ways in which these diverse associations can be studied experimentally.},

The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.04.005},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptors have been associated with dysfunctional emotional processing biases in mood disorders. These receptors further predominantly mediate the subjective and behavioral effects of psilocybin and might be important for its recently suggested antidepressive effects. However, the effect of psilocybin on emotional processing biases and the specific contribution of 5-HT2A receptors across different emotional domains is unknown.
METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study, 17 healthy human subjects received on 4 separate days placebo, psilocybin (215 μg/kg), the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were assessed by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related potential measurements were used to quantify facial emotional recognition and goal-directed behavior toward emotional cues.
RESULTS: Psilocybin enhanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative facial expression. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed behavior toward positive compared with negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited negative sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated the P300 component. Ketanserin alone had no effects but blocked the psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and decreased recognition of negative facial expression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that psilocybin shifts the emotional bias across various psychological domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central in mood regulation and emotional face recognition in healthy subjects. These findings may not only have implications for the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases but may also provide a framework to delineate the mechanisms underlying psylocybin's putative antidepressant effects.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Classical psychedelics, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are under investigation as potential therapeutic agents in psychiatry. Whereas most studies utilize relatively high doses, there are also reports of beneficial effects of "microdosing," or repeated use of very low doses of these drugs. The behavioral and neural effects of these low doses are not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of LSD (13 μg and 26 μg) versus placebo on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) responses in healthy adults.
METHODS: Twenty-two healthy men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 3 EEG sessions in which they received placebo or LSD (13 μg and 26 μg) under double-blind conditions. During each session, participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires at hourly intervals, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, EEG recordings were obtained, including resting-state neural oscillations in scalp electrodes over default mode network (DMN) regions and P300, N170, and P100 ERPs evoked during a visual oddball paradigm.
RESULTS: LSD dose-dependently reduced oscillatory power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands during both eyes closed and eyes open resting conditions. During the oddball task, LSD dose-dependently reduced ERP amplitudes for P300 and N170 components and increased P100 latency. LSD also produced dose-related increases in positive mood, elation, energy, and anxiety and increased heart rate and blood pressure. On a measure of altered states of consciousness, LSD dose-dependently increased Blissful State, but not other indices of perceptual or sensory effects typical of psychedelic drugs. The subjective effects of the drug were not correlated with the EEG measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of LSD produced broadband cortical desynchronization over the DMN during resting state and reduced P300 and N170 amplitudes, patterns similar to those reported with higher doses of psychedelics. Notably, these neurophysiological effects raise the possibility that very low doses of LSD may produce subtle behavioral and perhaps therapeutic effects that do not rely on the full psychedelic experience.},

Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) may underlie the expression of psychotic symptoms. This study used a roving mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to investigate whether the encoding of PE is affected by pharmacological manipulation of NMDAR or 5-HT(2A)R, and whether the encoding of PE under placebo can be used to predict drug-induced symptoms. Using a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design, S-ketamine and psilocybin, respectively, were administrated to two groups of healthy subjects. Psychological alterations were assessed using a revised version of the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC-R) questionnaire. As an index of PE, we computed changes in MMN amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding standards (MMN memory trace effect) during a roving paradigm. S-ketamine, but not psilocybin, disrupted PE processing as expressed by a frontally disrupted MMN memory trace effect. Although both drugs produced positive-like symptoms, the extent of PE processing under placebo only correlated significantly with the severity of cognitive impairments induced by S-ketamine. Our results suggest that the NMDAR, but not the 5-HT(2A)R system, is implicated in PE processing during the MMN paradigm, and that aberrant PE signaling may contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments. The assessment of the MMN memory trace in schizophrenia may allow detecting early phases of the illness and might also serve to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments, in particular of cognitive impairments.},

The most common findings of EEG features in AD and MCI patients are increased relative power of slow oscillations (delta and theta rhythms) and decreased relative power of fast oscillations (alpha, beta and gamma rhythms). However, impairments in cognitive processes in AD and MCI are not sufficiently reflected by brain oscillatory activity in a particular frequency band. MCI patients are at high risk of progressing to AD. Cross-frequency coupling (CFC), which refers to coupling between different frequency bands, is a crucial tool for comprehending changes in brain oscillations and cognitive performance. CFC features exhibit some specificity in patients with AD and MCI, but a comparison between CFC features in individuals with these disorders is still lacking.

Using such models, we show that changes in local coupling in frontotemporal dementia underlie the failure to adequately establish sensory predictions, leading to altered prediction error responses in a cortical information-processing hierarchy. Using machine learning, this model-based approach provided greater case–control classification accuracy than conventional evoked cortical responses. We suggest that this approach provides an in vivo platform for testing mechanistic hypotheses about disease progression and pharmacotherapeutics.},

The accumulated data suggest that MMN to duration deviance, unlike MMN to frequency deviance, is reduced in amplitude in aging at short ISIs. The attenuated MMN to frequency deviance observed at long ISIs in elderly subjects seems to be caused by age-related memory trace decay. Existing results suggest that automatic discrimination for the frequency change is not affected in the early phase of AD, whereas the memory trace seems to decay faster in AD patients. The present findings on PD are not as conclusive, although they tentatively suggest deteriorated automatic change detection.

	abstract = {The diversity of cognitive deficits and neuropathological processes associated with dementias has encouraged divergence in pathophysiological explanations of disease. Here, we review an alternative framework that emphasizes convergent critical features of cognitive pathophysiology. Rather than the loss of 'memory centres' or 'language centres', or singular neurotransmitter systems, cognitive deficits are interpreted in terms of aberrant predictive coding in hierarchical neural networks. This builds on advances in normative accounts of brain function, specifically the Bayesian integration of beliefs and sensory evidence in which hierarchical predictions and prediction errors underlie memory, perception, speech and behaviour. We describe how analogous impairments in predictive coding in parallel neurocognitive systems can generate diverse clinical phenomena, including the characteristics of dementias. The review presents evidence from behavioural and neurophysiological studies of perception, language, memory and decision-making. The reformulation of cognitive deficits in terms of predictive coding has several advantages. It brings diverse clinical phenomena into a common framework; it aligns cognitive and movement disorders; and it makes specific predictions on cognitive physiology that support translational and experimental medicine studies. The insights into complex human cognitive disorders from the predictive coding framework may therefore also inform future therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {People are remarkably capable of generating their own goals, beginning with child’s play and continuing into adulthood. Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals and goal-oriented behaviour, models are still far from capturing the richness of everyday human goals. Here we bridge this gap by collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals (in the form of scorable, single-player games), modelling them as reward-producing programs and generating novel human-like goals through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose, add temporal constraints and allow program execution on behavioural traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative model of goals, we learn a fitness function over the infinite set of possible goal programs and sample novel goals with a quality-diversity algorithm. Human evaluators found that model-generated goals, when sampled from partitions of program space occupied by human examples, were indistinguishable from human-created games. We also discovered that our model’s internal fitness scores predict games that are evaluated as more fun to play and more human-like.},

The theory of higher-order topological dynamics, which combines higher-order interactions with discrete topology and nonlinear dynamics, has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex systems, such as the brain and the climate, and to advance the development of next-generation AI algorithms. This theoretical framework, which goes beyond traditional node-centric descriptions, encodes the dynamics of a network through topological signals—variables assigned not only to nodes but also to edges, triangles and other higher-order cells. Recent findings show that topological signals lead to the emergence of distinct types of dynamical state and collective phenomena, including topological and Dirac synchronization, pattern formation and triadic percolation. These results offer insights into how topology shapes dynamics, how dynamics learns topology and how topology evolves dynamically. This Perspective primarily aims to guide physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and network scientists through the emerging field of higher-order topological dynamics, while also outlining future research challenges.},

These observations motivate a dynamical systems framework for neural network activity that focuses on the concept of {\textbackslash}emph\{latent processing units,\} core elements for robust coding and computation embedded in collective neural dynamics. Our theoretical treatment of these latent processing units yields five key attributes of computing through neural network dynamics. First, neural computations that are low-dimensional can nevertheless generate high-dimensional neural dynamics. Second, the manifolds defined by neural dynamical trajectories exhibit an inherent coding redundancy as a direct consequence of the universal computing capabilities of the underlying dynamical system. Third, linear readouts or decoders of neural population activity can suffice to optimally subserve downstream circuits controlling behavioral outputs. Fourth, whereas recordings from thousands of neurons may suffice for near optimal decoding from instantaneous neural activity patterns, experimental access to millions of neurons may be necessary to predict neural ensemble dynamical trajectories across timescales of seconds. Fifth, despite the variable activity of single cells, neural networks can maintain stable representations of the variables computed by the latent processing units, thereby making computations robust to representational drift. Overall, our framework for latent computation provides an analytic description and empirically testable predictions regarding how large systems of neurons perform robust computations via their collective dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the context of consciousness studies, a key challenge is how to rigorously conceptualise first-person phenomenological descriptions of lived experience and their relation to third-person empirical measurements of the activity or dynamics of the brain and body. Since the 1990s, there has been a coordinated effort to explicitly combine first-person phenomenological methods, generating qualitative data, with neuroscientific techniques used to describe and quantify brain activity under the banner of "neurophenomenology". Here, we take on this challenge and develop an approach to neurophenomenology from a mathematical perspective. We harness recent advances in theoretical neuroscience and the physics of cognitive systems to mathematically conceptualise first-person experience and its correspondence with neural and behavioural dynamics. Throughout, we make the operating assumption that the content of first-person experience can be formalised as (or related to) a belief (i.e. a probability distribution) that encodes an organism's best guesses about the state of its external and internal world (e.g. body or brain) as well as its uncertainty. We mathematically characterise phenomenology, bringing to light a tool-set to quantify individual phenomenological differences and develop several hypotheses including on the metabolic cost of phenomenology and on the subjective experience of time. We conceptualise the form of the generative passages between first- and third-person descriptions, and the mathematical apparatus that mutually constrains them, as well as future research directions. In summary, we formalise and characterise first-person subjective experience and its correspondence with third-person empirical measurements of brain and body, offering hypotheses for quantifying various aspects of phenomenology to be tested in future work.},

	abstract = {In principle, selective attention is the net result of target selection and distractor suppression. The way in which both mechanisms are implemented neurally has remained contested. Neural oscillatory power in the alpha frequency band (∼10 Hz) has been implicated in the selection of to-be-attended targets, but there is lack of empirical evidence for its involvement in the suppression of to-be-ignored distractors. Here, we use electroencephalography recordings of N = 33 human participants (males and females) to test the preregistered hypothesis that alpha power directly relates to distractor suppression and thus operates independently from target selection. In an auditory spatial pitch discrimination task, we modulated the location (left vs right) of either a target or a distractor tone sequence, while fixing the other in the front. When the distractor was fixed in the front, alpha power relatively decreased contralaterally to the target and increased ipsilaterally. Most importantly, when the target was fixed in the front, alpha lateralization reversed in direction for the suppression of distractors on the left versus right. These data show that target-selection-independent alpha power modulation is involved in distractor suppression. Although both lateralized alpha responses for selection and for suppression proved reliable, they were uncorrelated and distractor-related alpha power emerged from more anterior, frontal cortical regions. Lending functional significance to suppression-related alpha oscillations, alpha lateralization at the individual, single-trial level was predictive of behavioral accuracy. These results fuel a renewed look at neurobiological accounts of selection-independent suppressive filtering in attention.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although well established models of attention rest on the assumption that irrelevant sensory information is filtered out, the neural implementation of such a filter mechanism is unclear. Using an auditory attention task that decouples target selection from distractor suppression, we demonstrate that two sign-reversed lateralized alpha responses reflect target selection versus distractor suppression. Critically, these alpha responses are reliable, independent of each other, and generated in more anterior, frontal regions for suppression versus selection. Prediction of single-trial task performance from alpha modulation after stimulus onset agrees with the view that alpha modulation bears direct functional relevance as a neural implementation of attention. Results demonstrate that the neurobiological foundation of attention implies a selection-independent alpha oscillatory mechanism to suppress distraction.},

Remarkably, AI co-scientist top-ranked hypothesis matched our experimentally confirmed mechanism: cf-PICIs hijack diverse phage tails to expand their host range. We critically assess its five highest-ranked hypotheses, showing that some opened new research avenues in our laboratories.

Cortico–hippocampal interactions likely mediate this interplay, but underlying circuit mechanisms remain elusive. Unlike the entorhinal cortex-to-hippocampus pathway, we know little about the organization and function of the hippocampus-to-cortex feedback circuit. Here we report in mice, two functionally distinct parallel hippocampus-to-entorhinal cortex feedback pathways: the canonical disynaptic route via layer 5 and a novel monosynaptic input to layer 2/3. Circuit mapping reveals that hippocampal input predominantly drives excitation in layer 5 but feed-forward inhibition in layer 2/3. Upon repetitive pairing with cortical layer 1 inputs, hippocampal inputs undergo homosynaptic potentiation in layer 5, but induce heterosynaptic plasticity and spike output in layer 2/3. Behaviorally, hippocampal inputs to layer 5 and layer 2/3 support object memory encoding versus recall, respectively. Two-photon imaging during navigation reveals hippocampal suppression reduces spatially tuned cortical axonal activity. We present a model, where hippocampal feedback could iteratively shape ongoing cortical processing.},

Contrary to the prevalent notion that it simply "waxes and wanes," spontaneous alpha activity bursts erratically between two distinct modes of activity. We now establish a mechanism for this multistable phenomenon in resting-state cortical recordings by characterizing the complex dynamics of a biophysical model of macroscopic corticothalamic activity. This is achieved by studying the predicted activity of cortical and thalamic neuronal populations in this model as a function of its dynamic stability and the role of nonspecific synaptic noise. We hence find that fluctuating noisy inputs into thalamic neurons elicit spontaneous bursts between low- and high-amplitude alpha oscillations when the system is near a particular type of dynamical instability, namely a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. When the postsynaptic potentials associated with these noisy inputs are modulated by cortical feedback, the SD of power within each of these modes scale in proportion to their mean, showing remarkable concordance with empirical data. Our state-dependent corticothalamic model hence exhibits multistability and scale-invariant fluctuations-key features of resting-state cortical activity and indeed, of human perception, cognition, and behavior-thus providing a unified account of these apparently divergent phenomena.},

However, there is considerable variability in individual responses to transcranial direct current stimulation, and the factors influencing treatment effectiveness in targeted regions are not well understood. We aimed to assess how the extent and depth of the epileptogenic zone and associated networks impact patient responses to transcranial direct current stimulation therapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of stereoelectroencephalography data from 23 patients participating in a personalized multichannel transcranial direct current stimulation protocol. We evaluated the extent and depth of the epileptogenic zone network, propagation zone network, and the combined network of the entire epileptogenic and propagation zones, correlating these factors with clinical response measured by the reduction in seizure frequency following repeated transcranial direct current stimulation sessions. Among the patients, 10 (43.5\%) were classified as responders (R), experiencing a significant (\&gt;50\%) decrease in seizure frequency, while 13 were non-responders, showing minimal improvement or increased seizure frequency. Importantly, we found a significant positive correlation between the extent of the epileptogenic zone network and changes in seizure frequency. A smaller epileptogenic zone network extent was associated with better transcranial direct current stimulation efficacy, with responders demonstrating a significantly smaller epileptogenic and propagation zones compared with non-responders. Additionally, non-responders tended to have a significantly deeper epileptogenic zone network compared with responders. Our results highlight the significant impact of the extent and depth of the epileptogenic zone network on transcranial direct current stimulation efficacy in patients with refractory focal epilepsy. Responders typically exhibited a smaller and shallower epileptogenic zone network compared with non-responders. These findings suggest that utilizing individualized epileptogenic zone network characteristics could help refine patient selection for personalized transcranial direct current stimulation protocols, potentially improving therapeutic outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background Depression is associated with a range of adverse physical health outcomes. We aimed to quantify the association between depression and the subsequent rate of accrual of long-term physical health conditions in middle and older age. Methods and findings We included 172,556 participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort study, aged 40–71 years old at baseline assessment (2006–2010), who had linked primary care data available. Using self-report, primary care, hospital admission, cancer registry, and death records, we ascertained 69 long-term physical health conditions at both UKB baseline assessment and during a mean follow-up of 6.9 years. We used quasi-Poisson models to estimate associations between history of depression at baseline and subsequent rate of physical condition accrual. Within our cohort, 30,770 (17.8\%) had a history of depression. Compared to those without depression, participants with depression had more physical conditions at baseline (mean 2.9 [SD 2.3] versus 2.1 [SD 1.9]) and accrued additional physical conditions at a faster rate (mean 0.20 versus 0.16 additional conditions/year during follow-up). After adjustment for age and sex, participants with depression accrued physical morbidities at a faster rate than those without depression (RR 1.32, 95\% confidence interval [CI] [1.31, 1.34]). After adjustment for all sociodemographic characteristics, the rate of condition accrual remained higher in those with versus without depression (RR 1.30, 95\% CI [1.28, 1.32]). This association attenuated but remained statistically significant after additional adjustment for baseline condition count and social/lifestyle factors (RR 1.10, 95\% CI [1.09, 1.12]). The main limitation of this study is healthy volunteer selection bias, which may limit generalisability of findings to the wider population. Conclusions Middle-aged and older adults with a history of depression have more long-term physical health conditions at baseline and accrue additional physical conditions at a faster rate than those without a history of depression. Our findings highlight the importance of integrated approaches to managing both mental and physical health outcomes.},

Importantly, while high-frequency brain activity reflects local domains of cortical processing, low-frequency brain rhythms are dynamically entrained across distributed brain regions by both external sensory input and internal cognitive events. CFC may thus serve as a mechanism to transfer information from large-scale brain networks operating at behavioral timescales to the fast, local cortical processing required for effective computation and synaptic modification, thus integrating functional systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales.},

As point processes single spikes contain little information in themselves, i.e., outside the context of spikes from other neurons. Moreover, they may fail to cross a synapse. A burst, which consists of a short, high frequency train of spikes, will more reliably cross a synapse, increasing the likelihood of eliciting a postsynaptic spike, depending on the specific short-term plasticity at that synapse. Both the number and the temporal pattern of spikes in a burst provide a coding space that lies within the temporal integration realm of single neurons. Bursts have been observed in many species, including the non-mammalian, and in brain regions that range from subcortical to cortical. Despite their widespread presence and potential relevance, the uncertainties of how to classify bursts seems to have limited the research into the coding possibilities for bursts. The present series of research articles provides new insights into the relevance and interpretation of bursts across different neural circuits, and new methods for their analysis.

	abstract = {Time is of the essence in how neural codes, synchronies, and oscillations might function in encoding, representation, transmission, integration, storage, and retrieval of information in brains. This Hypothesis and Theory article examines observed and possible relations between codes, synchronies, oscillations, and types of neural networks they require. Toward reverse-engineering informational functions in brains, prospective, alternative neural architectures incorporating principles from radio modulation and demodulation, active reverberant circuits, distributed content-addressable memory, signal-signal time-domain correlation and convolution operations, spike-correlation-based holography, and self-organizing, autoencoding anticipatory systems are outlined. Synchronies and oscillations are thought to subserve many possible functions: sensation, perception, action, cognition, motivation, affect, memory, attention, anticipation, and imagination. These include direct involvement in coding attributes of events and objects through phase-locking as well as characteristic patterns of spike latency and oscillatory response. They are thought to be involved in segmentation and binding, working memory, attention, gating and routing of signals, temporal reset mechanisms, inter-regional coordination, time discretization, time-warping transformations, and support for temporal wave-interference based operations. A high level, partial taxonomy of neural codes consists of channel, temporal pattern, and spike latency codes. The functional roles of synchronies and oscillations in candidate neural codes, including oscillatory phase-offset codes, are outlined. Various forms of multiplexing neural signals are considered: time-division, frequency-division, code-division, oscillatory-phase, synchronized channels, oscillatory hierarchies, polychronous ensembles. An expandable, annotative neural spike train framework for encoding low- and high-level attributes of events and objects is proposed. Coding schemes require appropriate neural architectures for their interpretation. Time-delay, oscillatory, wave-interference, synfire chain, polychronous, and neural timing networks are discussed. Some novel concepts for formulating an alternative, more time-centric theory of brain function are discussed. As in radio communication systems, brains can be regarded as networks of dynamic, adaptive transceivers that broadcast and selectively receive multiplexed temporally-patterned pulse signals. These signals enable complex signal interactions that select, reinforce, and bind common subpatterns and create emergent lower dimensional signals that propagate through spreading activation interference networks. If memory traces share the same kind of temporal pattern forms as do active neuronal representations, then distributed, holograph-like content-addressable memories are made possible via temporal pattern resonances.},

	abstract = {The complexity of natural environments requires highly flexible mechanisms for adaptive processing of single and multiple stimuli. Neuronal oscillations could be an ideal candidate for implementing such flexibility in neural systems. Here, we present a framework for structuring attention-guided processing of complex visual scenes in humans, based on multiplexing and phase coding schemes. Importantly, we suggest that the dynamic fluctuations of excitability vary rapidly in terms of magnitude, frequency and wave-form over time, i.e., they are not necessarily sinusoidal or sustained oscillations. Different elements of single objects would be processed within a single cycle (burst) of alpha activity (7–14 Hz), allowing for the formation of coherent object representations while separating multiple objects across multiple cycles. Each element of an object would be processed separately in time—expressed as different gamma band bursts ({\textgreater}30 Hz)—along the alpha phase. Since the processing capacity per alpha cycle is limited, an inverse relationship between object resolution and size of attentional spotlight ensures independence of the proposed mechanism from absolute object complexity. Frequency and wave-shape of those fluctuations would depend on the nature of the object that is processed and on cognitive demands. Multiple objects would further be organized along the phase of slower fluctuations (e.g., theta), potentially driven by saccades. Complex scene processing, involving covert attention and eye movements, would therefore be associated with multiple frequency changes in the alpha and lower frequency range. This framework embraces the idea of a hierarchical organization of visual processing, independent of environmental temporal dynamics.},

Accordingly, speech tasks that measure linguistic development in children may exhibit systematic properties regarding AM structure. Here the acoustic structure of spoken items in child phonological and morphological tasks, phoneme deletion and plural elicitation, was investigated. The phase synchronisation index (PSI), reflecting the degree of phase alignment between pairs of AMs, was computed for 3 AM bands (delta, theta, beta/low gamma; 0.9-2.5 Hz, 2.5-12 Hz, 12-40 Hz respectively), for five spectral bands covering 100 – 7250 Hz. For phoneme deletion, data from 94 child participants with and without dyslexia was used to relate AM structure to behavioural performance. Results revealed that a significant change in magnitude of the phase synchronisation index (ΔPSI) of slower AMs (delta-theta) systematically accompanied both phoneme deletion and plural elicitation. Further, children with dyslexia made more linguistic errors as the delta-theta ΔPSI increased. Accordingly, ΔPSI between slower temporal modulations in the speech signal systematically distinguished test items from accurate responses and predicted task performance. This may suggest that sensitivity to slower AM information in speech is a core aspect of phonological and morphological development.},

Here, we monitored continuous speech processing with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to unravel the principles of speech segmentation and coding. We demonstrate that speech entrains the phase of low-frequency (delta, theta) and the amplitude of high-frequency (gamma) oscillations in the auditory cortex. Phase entrainment is stronger in the right and amplitude entrainment is stronger in the left auditory cortex. Furthermore, edges in the speech envelope phase reset auditory cortex oscillations thereby enhancing their entrainment to speech. This mechanism adapts to the changing physical features of the speech envelope and enables efficient, stimulus-specific speech sampling. Finally, we show that within the auditory cortex, coupling between delta, theta, and gamma oscillations increases following speech edges. Importantly, all couplings (i.e., brain-speech and also within the cortex) attenuate for backward-presented speech, suggesting top-down control. We conclude that segmentation and coding of speech relies on a nested hierarchy of entrained cortical oscillations., Continuous speech is organized into a nested hierarchy of quasi-rhythmic components (prosody, syllables, phonemes) with different time scales. Interestingly, neural activity in the human auditory cortex shows rhythmic modulations with frequencies that match these speech rhythms. Here, we use magnetoencephalography and information theory to study brain oscillations in participants as they process continuous speech. We show that auditory brain oscillations at different frequencies align with the rhythmic structure of speech. This alignment is more precise when participants listen to intelligible rather than unintelligible speech. The onset of speech resets brain oscillations and improves their alignment to speech rhythms; it also improves the alignment between the different frequencies of nested brain oscillations in the auditory cortex. Since these brain oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in neural excitability, they are strong candidates for mediating the segmentation of continuous speech at different time scales corresponding to key speech components such as syllables and phonemes.},

	abstract = {Statistical learning of physical stimulus characteristics is important for the development of cognitive systems like language and music. Rhythm patterns are a core component of both systems, and rhythm is key to language acquisition by infants. Accordingly, the physical stimulus characteristics that yield speech rhythm in “Babytalk” may also describe the hierarchical rhythmic relationships that characterize human music and song. Computational modelling of the amplitude envelope of “Babytalk” (infant-directed speech, IDS) using a demodulation approach (Spectral-Amplitude Modulation Phase Hierarchy model, S-AMPH) can describe these characteristics. S-AMPH modelling of Babytalk has shown previously that bands of amplitude modulations (AMs) at different temporal rates and their phase relations help to create its structured inherent rhythms. Additionally, S-AMPH modelling of children’s nursery rhymes shows that different rhythm patterns (trochaic, iambic, dactylic) depend on the phase relations between AM bands centred on {\textasciitilde}2 Hz and {\textasciitilde}5 Hz. The importance of these AM phase relations was confirmed via a second demodulation approach (PAD, Probabilistic Amplitude Demodulation). Here we apply both S-AMPH and PAD to demodulate the amplitude envelopes of Western musical genres and songs. Quasi-rhythmic and non-human sounds found in nature (birdsong, rain, wind) were utilized for control analyses. We expected that the physical stimulus characteristics in human music and song from an AM perspective would match those of IDS. Given prior speech-based analyses, we also expected that AM cycles derived from the modelling may identify musical units like crotchets, quavers and demi-quavers. Both models revealed an hierarchically-nested AM modulation structure for music and song, but not nature sounds. This AM modulation structure for music and song matched IDS. Both models also generated systematic AM cycles yielding musical units like crotchets and quavers. Both music and language are created by humans and shaped by culture. Acoustic rhythm in IDS and music appears to depend on many of the same physical characteristics, facilitating learning.},

	abstract = {How best to explain the properties and capabilities of embodied minds? The conventional paradigm holds that living beings are to be understood as the sculpted products of genetics and environment, which determine form and function of the brain as the unique seat of intelligence. Some provision is made for emergence and complexity, as additional “facts that hold” about networks, circuits, and other components of life. Here, I present a sketch of a framework and research roadmap that differs from this view in key aspects. First, the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms and functionality indicate fundamental symmetries between the self-construction of bodies and of minds, revealing a much broader view of diverse intelligence across the agential material of life beyond neural substrates. Second, surprising competencies (not just complexity or unpredictability) in systems that have not had a history of selection for those abilities suggest an additional input into patterns of body and mind that motivates a research program on a latent space of patterns ingressing into the physical world. Emphasizing the principles of continuity and pragmatism, and using morphogenesis as a tractable model system in which to develop these ideas, I explore the implications of the following ideas: (A) Evolution favors living forms that exploit powerful truths of mathematics and computation as affordances, which contribute as causes of morphological and behavioral features.  (B) Cognitive patterns are an evolutionary pivot of the collective intelligence of cells; given this symmetry between neuroscience and developmental biology, I propose that the relationship between mind and brain is the same as the relationship between mathematical patterns and the morphogenetic outcomes they guide. (C) Many mathematicians, and a non-mysterian approach to science in general, suggest that these patterns are not random facts to be merely cataloged as “emergence” when found, but rather can be systematically discovered within a structured, ordered (non-physical) space. Therefore, I hypothesize that: (1) instances of embodied cognition likewise ingress from a Platonic space, which contains not only low-agency patterns like facts about triangles and prime numbers, but also higher agency ones such as kinds of minds; (2) we take seriously for developmental, synthetic, and behavioral biology the kinds of non-physicalist ideas that are already a staple of Platonist mathematics; (3) what evolution (and bioengineering, and possibly AI) produces are pointers into that Platonic space – physical interfaces that enable the ingression of specific patterns of body and mind.  This provides a new perspective on the organicist/mechanist debate by explaining why traditional computationalist views of life and mind are insufficient, while at the same time erasing artificial distinctions between life and machine, since both are in-formed by diverse patterns from the latent space. I sketch a research program, already begun, of using the tools of the fields of synthetic morphology and diverse intelligence to map out key regions of the Platonic space. Understanding the mapping between the architecture of physical embodiments and the patterns to which they point has massive implications for evolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, AI, and the ethics of synthbiosis with the forthcoming immense diversity of morally important beings.},

Here, we introduce a deep model to generate a person's entire connectome exclusively based on their age, sex, body phenotypes, cognition, and lifestyle factors. Using the richly phenotyped UK Biobank connectome cohort (N=8,086), we demonstrate that our model can generate network architectures that closely recapitulate connectomes mapped empirically using diffusion MRI and tractography. We find that age, sex, and body phenotypes exert the strongest influence on the connectome generation process, with an impact approximately four times greater than that of cognition and lifestyle factors. Regional differences in the importance of measures were observed, including an increased importance of cognition in the association cortex relative to the visual system. We further show that generated connectomes can improve the training of machine learning models and reduce their predictive errors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inferring brain connectivity from an individual's personal data and enables future applications of connectome generation such as data augmentation and anonymous data sharing.},

Leveraging vision as a beachhead, our findings highlight the alteration of contextual computations as a potential general mechanism underlying psychedelic action.

While it has advantages such as affordability, home-use application and fewer side effects its clinical efficacy is not yet established. This randomized, sham-controlled trial (NCT06165445) compares efficacy of an optimized multichannel protocol vs conventional and sham tDCS for depression treatment. Methods and Materials: Sixty patients with major depression received 30 sessions of conventional, optimized multichannel, or sham tDCS in parallel groups. In the multichannel optimized tDCS, electrical current was delivered via 7 small electrodes (1.65 mA max current per electrode, 4.0 mA total injected current per polarity) while in the conventional (2 mA max current per electrode, 2.0 mA total injected current per polarity) and sham tDCS large anodal and cathodal electrodes were used. Intervention efficacy and treatment response were evaluated before treatment and after the 10th, 20th, and 30th sessions, 1- and 3-months post-intervention. Cognitive functions and brain connectivity were also assessed. Results: Both active tDCS groups showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the sham group, with the multichannel protocol demonstrating effects as early as the 10th session and achieving greater symptom alleviation than conventional tDCS. A response rate of 72.7\% is observed, based on at least a 50\% improvement in depressive scores from baseline at 1 month (Hedges g=2.80) and 3 months (Hedges g=2.31) post-treatment. Furthermore, the multichannel protocol improved cognitive functions and enhanced cerebral functional connectivity markers of depression pathophysiology. Discussion: The optimized multichannel tDCS showed high efficacy for treating depression.},

	abstract = {Electrophysiological signals (electroencephalography, EEG, and magnetoencephalography, MEG), as many natural processes, exhibit scale-invariance properties resulting in a power-law (1/f) spectrum. Interestingly, EEG and MEG differ in their slopes, which could be explained by several mechanisms, including non-resistive properties of tissues. Our goal in the present study is to estimate the impact of space/frequency structure of source signals as a putative mechanism to explain spectral scaling properties of neuroimaging signals. We performed simulations based on the summed contribution of cortical patches with different sizes (ranging from 0.4 to 104.2 cm2). Small patches were attributed signals of high frequencies, whereas large patches were associated with signals of low frequencies, on a logarithmic scale. The tested parameters included i) the space/frequency structure (range of patch sizes and frequencies) and ii) the amplitude factor c parametrizing the spatial scale ratios. We found that the space/frequency structure may cause differences between EEG and MEG scale-free spectra that are compatible with real data findings reported in previous studies. We also found that below a certain spatial scale, there were no more differences between EEG and MEG, suggesting a limit for the resolution of both methods.Our work provides an explanation of experimental findings. This does not rule out other mechanisms for differences between EEG and MEG, but suggests an important role of spatio-temporal structure of neural dynamics. This can help the analysis and interpretation of power-law measures in EEG and MEG, and we believe our results can also impact computational modeling of brain dynamics, where different local connectivity structures could be used at different frequencies.},

	abstract = {In EEG recordings rhythmicities usually pop out from the background and coexist with irregular, arrhythmic patterns. The amplitude of arrhythmic oscillations decreases with frequency according to the power-law function. Infraslow spontaneous oscillations of human cortical potential were discovered in the middle of the 20th century. There are at least two types of spontaneous electrical infraslow oscillations: 1) periodic oscillations with a peak frequency around 0.1 Hz, and 2) arrhythmic fluctuations with no clear peak at EEG spectrograms. Strong experimental evidence suggests that the 0.1 Hz oscillations are associated with local hemodynamic regulatory oscillations in the human brain. The neuronal source of the aperiodic infraslow spontaneous fluctuations is not so clear. Functional meaning of the infra-slow oscillations is based on two facts: 1) the phase of these oscillations correlates with human psychophysical performance, and 2) the phase also correlates with amplitude of oscillations in higher frequency bands. Although these findings are correlational, there is a temptation to suggest that the infraslow potentials of the human brain reflect fluctuations in cortical excitability which in turn modulates faster fluctuations in the brain state and behavioral performance.},

Without a unifying principle, each experiment seemingly uncovers new anomalies or coding types. Here, we provide a unifying principle that the mental representation of space is an emergent property of latent higher-order sequence learning. Treating space as a sequence resolves numerous phenomena and suggests that the place field mapping methodology that interprets sequential neuronal responses in Euclidean terms might itself be a source of anomalies. Our model, clone-structured causal graph (CSCG), employs higher-order graph scaffolding to learn latent representations by mapping aliased egocentric sensory inputs to unique contexts. Learning to compress sequential and episodic experiences using CSCGs yields allocentric cognitive maps that are suitable for planning, introspection, consolidation, and abstraction. By explicating the role of Euclidean place field mapping and demonstrating how latent sequential representations unify myriad observed phenomena, our work positions the hippocampus in a sequence-centric paradigm, challenging the prevailing space-centric view.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the aggregation of β-amyloid, a pathological feature believed to drive the neuronal loss and cognitive decline commonly seen in the disease. Given the growing prevalence of this progressive neurodegenerative disease, understanding the exact mechanisms underlying this process has become a top priority. Microelectrode arrays are commonly used for chronic, non-invasive recording of both spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity from diverse in vitro disease models and to evaluate therapeutic or toxic compounds. To date, microelectrode arrays have been used to investigate β-amyloids’ toxic effects, β-amyloids role in specific pathological features and to assess pharmacological approaches to treat Alzheimer’s disease. The versatility of microelectrode arrays means these studies use a variety of methods and investigate different disease models and brain regions. This review provides an overview of these studies, highlighting their disparities and presenting the status of the current literature. Despite methodological differences, the current literature indicates that β-amyloid has an inhibitory effect on synaptic plasticity and induces network connectivity disruptions. β-amyloid’s effect on spontaneous neuronal activity appears more complex. Overall, the literature corroborates the theory that β-amyloid induces neurotoxicity, having a progressive deleterious effect on neuronal signaling and plasticity. These studies also confirm that microelectrode arrays are valuable tools for investigating β-amyloid pathology from a functional perspective, helping to bridge the gap between cellular and network pathology and disease symptoms. The use of microelectrode arrays provides a functional insight into Alzheimer’s disease pathology which will aid in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.},

Even though many recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been proposed to simulate WM, most networks are designed to match respective experimental observations and show either transient or persistent activities. Those few which consider networks with both activity patterns have not attempted to directly compare their memory capabilities. In this study, we build transient-trajectory-based RNNs (TRNNs) and compare them to vanilla RNNs with more persistent activities. The TRNN incorporates biologically plausible modifications, including self-inhibition, sparse connection and hierarchical topology. Besides activity patterns resembling animal recordings and retained versatility to variable encoding time, TRNNs show better performance in delayed choice and spatial memory reinforcement learning tasks. Therefore, this study provides evidence supporting the transient activity theory to explain the WM mechanism from the model designing point of view.},

	abstract = {Neuronal dysfunction in specific brain regions or across distributed brain networks is a known feature of Alzheimer's disease. An often reported finding in the early stage of the disease is the presence of increased functional MRI (fMRI) blood oxygenation level-dependent signal under task conditions relative to cognitively normal controls, a phenomenon known as 'hyperactivation'. However, research in the past decades yielded complex, sometimes conflicting results. The magnitude and topology of fMRI hyperactivation patterns have been found to vary across the preclinical and clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease, including concomitant 'hypoactivation' in some cases. These incongruences are likely due to a range of factors, including the disease stage at which the cohort is examined, the brain areas or networks studied and the fMRI paradigm utilized to evoke these functional abnormalities. Additionally, a perennial question pertains to the nature of hyperactivation in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Some propose it reflects compensatory mechanisms to sustain cognitive performance, while others suggest it is linked to the pathological disruption of a highly regulated homeostatic cycle that contributes to, or even drives, disease progression. Providing a coherent narrative for these empirical and conceptual discrepancies is paramount to develop disease models, understand the synergy between hyperactivation and the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade and tailor effective interventions. We first provide a comprehensive overview of functional brain changes spanning the course from normal ageing to the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer's disease. We then highlight evidence supporting a close relationship between fMRI hyperactivation and in vivo markers of Alzheimer's pathology. We primarily focus on task-based fMRI studies in humans, but also consider studies using different functional imaging techniques and animal models. We then discuss the potential mechanisms underlying hyperactivation in the context of Alzheimer's disease and provide a testable framework bridging hyperactivation, ageing, cognition and the Alzheimer's disease pathological cascade. We conclude with a discussion of future challenges and opportunities to advance our understanding of the fundamental disease mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, and the promising development of therapeutic interventions incorporating or aimed at hyperactivation and large-scale functional systems.},

Patients whose illness fails to respond to at least five treatments may be considered to have severely treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to document the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with severe TRD.Methods:This was a 12-week, open-label trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants were 18–65 years of age, in a major depressive episode with documented insufficient benefit from at least five treatments during the current episode. A single dose of synthetic psilocybin (25 mg) was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing through at least 3 weeks post-dosing. Therapists met with patients for three sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for three integration sessions posttreatment. The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures including MADRS scores up to 12 weeks posttreatment, and subject-rated scales capturing depression and level of function were completed at baseline and all subsequent visits.Results:Twelve participants (six male, six female; mean age=40.6 years [SD=9.6]) with severe TRD were followed over the study period. Depressive symptoms were significantly decreased at week 3 (MADRS least-squares mean change=−15.8, 95\% CI=−25.4 to −6.3) and Week 12 (MADRS least-squares mean change=−17.2, 95\% CI=−25.2 to −9.1). In exploratory analyses, the Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) dimension of the psychedelic experience correlated with post-dosing antidepressant responses. Patients with comorbid PTSD (N=5) showed significantly less antidepressant effect of psilocybin.Conclusions:This open-label study suggests efficacy and safety of psilocybin in severe TRD and supports further study of psychedelics in this population, including consideration of PTSD interaction effects.},

	abstract = {Behaviorally relevant brain oscillations relate to each other in a specific manner to allow neuronal networks of different sizes with wide variety of connections to cooperate in a coordinated manner. For example, thalamo-cortical and hippocampal oscillations form numerous frequency bands, which follow a general rule. Specifically, the center frequencies and frequency ranges of oscillation bands with successively faster frequencies, from ultra-slow to ultra-fast frequency oscillations, form an arithmetic progression on the natural logarithmic scale. Due to mathematical properties of natural logarithm, the cycle lengths (periods) of oscillations, as an inverse of frequency, also form an arithmetic progression after natural logarithmic transformation. As a general rule, the neuronal excitability is larger during a certain phase of the oscillation period. Because the intervals between these activation phases and the temporal window of activation vary in proportion to the length of the oscillation period, lower frequency oscillations allow for an integration of neuronal effects with longer delays and larger variability in delays and larger areas of involvement. Neural representations based on these oscillations could therefore be complex. In contrast, high frequency oscillation bands allow for a more precise and spatially limited representation of information by incorporating synaptic events from closely located regions with short synaptic delays and limited variability. The large family of oscillation frequency bands with a constant relation may serve to overcome the information processing limitations imposed by the synaptic delays.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation marks have recently been used to build models known as epigenetic clocks, which predict calendar age. As methylation of cytosine promotes C-to-T mutations, we hypothesized that the methylation changes observed with age should reflect the accrual of somatic mutations, and the two should yield analogous aging estimates. In an analysis of multimodal data from 9,331 human individuals, we found that CpG mutations indeed coincide with changes in methylation, not only at the mutated site but with pervasive remodeling of the methylome out to ±10 kilobases. This one-to-many mapping allows mutation-based predictions of age that agree with epigenetic clocks, including which individuals are aging more rapidly or slowly than expected. Moreover, genomic loci where mutations accumulate with age also tend to have methylation patterns that are especially predictive of age. These results suggest a close coupling between the accumulation of sporadic somatic mutations and the widespread changes in methylation observed over the course of life.},

	abstract = {The inverse effects of creatine supplementation and sleep deprivation on high energy phosphates, neural creatine, and cognitive performances suggest that creatine is a suitable candidate for reducing the negative effects of sleep deprivation. With this, the main obstacle is the limited exogenous uptake by the central nervous system (CNS), making creatine only effective over a long-term diet of weeks. Thus far, only repeated dosing of creatine over weeks has been studied, yielding detectable changes in CNS levels. Based on the hypothesis that a high extracellular creatine availability and increased intracellular energy consumption will temporarily increase the central creatine uptake, subjects were orally administered a high single dose of creatinemonohydrate (0.35 g/kg) while performing cognitive tests during sleep deprivation. Two consecutive 31P-MRS scans, 1H-MRS, and cognitive tests were performed each at evening baseline, 3, 5.5, and 7.5 h after single dose creatine (0.35 g/kg) or placebo during sub-total 21 h sleep deprivation (SD). Our results show that creatine induces changes in PCr/Pi, ATP, tCr/tNAA, prevents a drop in pH level, and improves cognitive performance and processing speed. These outcomes suggest that a high single dose of creatine can partially reverse metabolic alterations and fatigue-related cognitive deterioration.},

Crucially, the scheme operates online, assimilating data to optimize the conditional density on time-varying states and time-invariant parameters. In contrast to Kalman and Particle smoothing, Generalised Filtering does not require a backwards pass. In contrast to variational schemes, it does not assume conditional independence between the states and parameters. Generalised Filtering optimises the conditional density with respect to a free-energy bound on the model′s log-evidence. This optimisation uses the generalised motion of hidden states and parameters, under the prior assumption that the motion of the parameters is small. We describe the scheme, present comparative evaluations with a fixed-form variational version, and conclude with an illustrative application to a nonlinear state-space model of brain imaging time-series.},

By mitigating mode collapse through TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which exhibit unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance on zero-shot forecasting.

	abstract = {Introduction Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) provides a treatment option for patients not eligible for surgical intervention or who seek low-risk approaches and may be used in the hospital, clinic and at home. Our objective is to summarize our single-center experience with multiple NIBS approaches for the treatment of focal epilepsy.
Methods A retrospective chart review identified drug resistant focal epilepsy patients who received NIBS as an epilepsy treatment at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Patients were typically treated as follows: (1) for TMS, 1 Hz stimulation was applied for five consecutive days in the neuromodulation clinic, (2) for outpatient tDCS, stimulation was applied for five consecutive days in the clinic, followed by optional treatment at home (3) for inpatient tDCS, stimulation was applied for three consecutive days. We analyzed continuous EEG data for the inpatient tDCS cohort and available HD-EEG data for outpatient cohorts to quantify changes in interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) as a result of stimulation. Outcomes were assessed at 1-month for TMS and outpatient tDCS and 1-week for inpatient tDCS.
Results 24 patients were treated with TMS (n=10) and tDCS (n=14, 9 as outpatients). The median age was 40 years (range 15-73). The median seizure reduction following stimulation was 50\%. 14 patients (58 \%) were responders to treatment (TMS=4/10, tDCS Outpatient =7/9, tDCS Inpatient=3/5). Five outpatient tDCS participants elected to continue treatment at home. 4 TMS and 4 outpatient tDCS underwent high density EEG before and after 5 days of therapy. Following stimulation, IED rate was reduced in 4/5 inpatient tDCS patients, 4/4 outpatient tDCS patients, and 4/4 TMS patients. Two patients experienced an increase in seizure frequency (1 following TMS and 1 following outpatient tDCS), which returned to baseline 4-6 weeks after stimulation treatments were discontinued.
Conclusions TMS and tDCS are potential treatment approaches for drug resistant focal epilepsy patients in the hospital, clinic, and home. They have a favorable safety profile and can lead to a reduction in IEDs rates and seizures. These results suggest further studies are needed to examine NIBS as treatment for epilepsy.
Plain Language Summary Noninvasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, offer new treatment options for patients with focal seizures. This study reviewed the experience at Mayo Clinic using noninvasive brain stimulation in the hospital, clinic and at-home settings to treat seizures. Results showed an overall 50\% median seizure reduction, and 58\% of patients had at least a 50\% reduction in seizures. Noninvasive brain stimulation is a promising treatment approach with a favorable safety profile.
Key PointsTranscranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) may reduce seizures in a variety of settingsTMS and tDCS can lead to a reduced interictal epileptiform discharge rate (IED)tDCS has the potential to be utilized safely at home by focal epilepsy patientsNoninvasive brain stimulation is well tolerated and safe in focal epilepsy patients},

Loving-kindness meditation (LKM), a specific subtype of meditative practice, involves focusing one’s attention on thoughts of well-being for oneself and others. Meditation has been proven to be beneficial in a variety of settings, including therapeutic applications, but the neural activity underlying meditative practices and their positive effects are not well understood. It has been difficult to understand the contribution of deep limbic structures given the difficulty of studying neural activity directly in the human brain. Here, we leverage a unique patient population, epilepsy patients chronically implanted with responsive neurostimulation devices that allow chronic, invasive electrophysiology recording to investigate the physiological correlates of LKM in the amygdala and hippocampus of novice meditators. We find that LKM-associated changes in physiological activity were specific to periodic, but not aperiodic, features of neural activity. LKM was associated with an increase in γ (30 to 55 Hz) power and an alternation in the duration of β (13 to 30 Hz) and γ oscillatory bursts in both the amygdala and hippocampus, two regions associated with mood disorders. These findings reveal the nature of LKM-induced modulation of limbic activity in first-time meditators.},

Another reason has to do with the lack of efforts from many medical schools to integrate evolution and its principles in their curriculum studiorum.

Given the lack of concrete biological markers, such as laboratory tests or imaging results, the development of diagnostic systems is difficult.This narrative review evaluated 9 diagnostic approaches. The validity of the DSM and the International Classification of Disorders (ICD) is limited. The Research Domain Criteria is a research framework, not a diagnostic system. The clinical utility of the quantitatively derived, dimensional Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology is questionable. The Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual Version 2 follows psychoanalytic theory and focuses on personality. Unlike the personality assessments in ICD-11 or DSM-5’s alternative model, based on pathological extremes of the big 5 traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism), it lacks foundation in empirical evidence. Network analytic approaches are intriguing, but their complexity makes them difficult to implement. Staging would be easier if individually predictive biological markers were available. The problem with all these new approaches is that they abstract patient experiences into higher-order constructs, potentially obscuring individual symptoms so much that they no longer reflect patients’ actual problems.ICD and DSM diagnoses can be questioned, but the reality of psychopathological symptoms, such as hallucinations, depression, anxiety, compulsions, and the suffering stemming from them, cannot. Therefore, it may be advisable to primarily describe patients according to the psychopathological symptoms they present, and any resulting personal syndromes, embedded in a framework of contextual clinical characterization including personality assessment and staging. The DSM and ICD are necessary for reimbursement, but they should be simplified and merged. A primarily psychopathological symptoms–based, clinical characterization approach would be multidimensional and clinically useful, because it would lead to problem-oriented treatment and support transdiagnostic research. It should be based on a universally used instrument to assess psychopathology and structured clinical characterization.},

Beyond this 'triggering' function, it has been typically presumed that Aβ and tau act independently and in the absence of specific interaction. However, accumulating evidence now suggests otherwise and contends that both pathologies have synergistic effects. This could not only help explain negative results from anti-Aβ clinical trials but also suggest that trials directed solely at tau may need to be reconsidered. Here, drawing from extensive human and disease model data, we highlight the latest evidence base pertaining to the complex Aβ-tau interaction and underscore its crucial importance to elucidating disease pathogenesis and the design of next-generation AD therapeutic trials.},

	abstract = {Aims.
To illuminate the pathological synergy between Aβ and tau leading to the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), here we have performed a comparative neuropathological study utilizing three distinctive variants of human tau (WT tau, P301L mutant tau and S320F mutant tau). Previously, in non-transgenic mice, we showed that WT tau or P301L tau does not form NFT while S320F tau can spontaneously aggregate into NFT, allowing us to test the selective vulnerability of these different tau conformations to the presence of Aβ plaques.

Methods.
We injected recombinant AAV-tau constructs into neonatal APP transgenic TgCRND8 mice or into 3 month old TgCRND8 mice; both cohorts were aged 3 months post injection. This allowed us to test how different tau variants synergize with soluble forms of Aβ (pre-deposit cohort) or with frank Aβ deposits (post-deposit cohort) respectively.

Results.
Expression of WT tau did not produce NFT or altered Aβ in either cohort. In the pre-deposit cohort, S320F tau induced Aβ plaque deposition, neuroinflammation and synaptic abnormalities, suggesting that early tau tangles affect the amyloid cascade. In the post-deposit cohort, contemporaneous expression of S320F tau did not exacerbate amyloid pathology, showing a dichotomy in Aβ-tau synergy based on the nature of Aβ. P301L tau produced NFT-type inclusions in the post-deposit cohort, but not in the pre-deposit cohort, indicating pathological synergy with pre-existing Aβ deposits.

Conclusions.
Our data shows that different tau mutations representing specific folding variants of tau synergize with Aβ to different extents, depending on the presence of cerebral deposits.},

Depression, defined in this context by a state of persistently low valence, may arise from various factors—including inaccurate world models (cognitive biases), a dysfunctional Objective Function (anhedonia, anxiety), deficient planning (executive deficits), or unfavorable environments. Integrating algorithmic, dynamical systems, and neurobiological concepts, we map the agent model to brain circuits and functional networks, framing potential etiological routes and linking with depression biotypes.

The intricate gut-brain axis, serving as a vital communication network between the gut and the brain, appears to wield influence in the progression of AD. Our study showcases the remarkable precision of x-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) in conducting an advanced three-dimensional examination of gut cellular composition and structure. The exploitation of micro- and nano-XPCT on various AD mouse models unveiled relevant alterations in villi and crypts, cellular transformations in Paneth and goblet cells, along with the detection of telocytes, neurons, erythrocytes, and mucus secretion by goblet cells within the gut cavity. The observed gut structural variations may elucidate the transition from dysbiosis to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder with an unclear pathophysiology. Damage to the hippocampal neurons is a key component of the plasticity regulation of synapses and plays a critical role in the mechanism of depression. There is evidence suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with synaptic impairment. The maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis includes quantitative maintenance and quality control of mitochondria. Mitochondrial biogenesis produces new and healthy mitochondria, and mitochondrial dynamics cooperates with mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria. These processes maintain mitochondrial population stability and exert neuroprotective effects against early depression. In contrast, mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in various brain regions of patients with major depressive disorders. The accumulation of defective mitochondria accelerates cellular nerve dysfunction. In addition, impaired mitochondria aggravate alterations in the brain microenvironment, promoting neuroinflammation and energy depletion, thereby exacerbating the development of depression. This review summarizes the influence of mitochondrial dysfunction and the underlying molecular pathways on the pathogenesis of depression. Additionally, we discuss the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis as a potential therapeutic strategy for depression.},

It was found that the model could produce a large variety of EEG-like waveforms and rhythms. Coupling two models, with delays in the interconnections to simulate the synaptic connections within and between cortical areas, made it possible to replicate the spatial distribution of alpha and beta activity. EPs were simulated by presenting pulses to the input of the coupled models. In general, the responses were more realistic than those produced using a single model.

	abstract = {The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have successfully applied a lightweight recurrent neural network (RNN) called Echo State Network (ESN) for EEG-based emotion recognition. These studies use intrinsic plasticity (IP) and synaptic plasticity (SP) to tune the hidden reservoir layer of ESN, yet they require extra training procedures and are often computationally complex. Recent neuroscientific research reveals that the brain is modular, consisting of internally dense and externally sparse subnetworks. Furthermore, it has been proved that this modular topology facilitates information processing efficiency in both biological and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Motivated by these findings, we propose Modular Echo State Network (M-ESN), where the hidden layer of ESN is directly initialized to a more efficient modular structure. In this paper, we first describe our novel implementation method, which enables us to find the optimal module numbers, local and global connectivity. Then, the M-ESN is benchmarked on the DEAP dataset. Lastly, we explain why network modularity improves model performance. We demonstrate that modular organization leads to a more diverse distribution of node degrees, which increases network heterogeneity and subsequently improves classification accuracy. On the emotion arousal, valence, and stress/calm classification tasks, our M-ESN outperforms regular ESN by 5.44, 5.90, and 5.42\%, respectively, while this difference when comparing with adaptation rules tuned ESNs are 0.77, 5.49, and 0.95\%. Notably, our results are obtained using M-ESN with a much smaller reservoir size and simpler training process.},

In this approach—which is termed Brainoware—computation is performed by sending and receiving information from the brain organoid using a high-density multielectrode array. By applying spatiotemporal electrical stimulation, nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties are achieved, as well as unsupervised learning from training data by reshaping the organoid functional connectivity.

Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.},

Our results show a transition in duration coding: from monotonic and spatially-dependent in early visual cortex to unimodal and spatially-invariant in frontal cortex. Along the dorsal visual stream, particularly in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), neuronal populations show common selective responses to both spatial and temporal information. In the IPS, spatial and temporal topographic organizations are also linked, although duration maps are smaller, less clustered, and more variable across participants. These findings help identify the mechanisms underlying human perception of visual duration and characterize the functional link between time and space processing, highlighting the importance of their interactions in shaping brain responses.},

Here, we study the dynamical aspects of this framework by examining how the requirement of tracking natural data drives the structural and dynamical properties of the agent. We first formalize the notion of a generative model using the language of symmetry from group theory, specifically employing Lie pseudogroups to describe the continuous transformations that characterize invariance in natural data. Then, adopting a generic neural network as a proxy for the agent dynamical system and drawing parallels to Noether’s theorem in physics, we demonstrate that data tracking forces the agent to mirror the symmetry properties of the generative world model. This dual constraint on the agent’s constitutive parameters and dynamical repertoire enforces a hierarchical organization consistent with the manifold hypothesis in the neural network. Our findings bridge perspectives from algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity, compressive modeling), symmetry (group theory), and dynamics (conservation laws, reduced manifolds), offering insights into the neural correlates of agenthood and structured experience in natural systems, as well as the design of artificial intelligence and computational models of the brain.},

Despite the positive effects, several issues regarding the way that levodopa changes brain activities have remained unclear. Methods. A combined strategy using EEG data and graph theory was used for investigating how levodopa changed connectome and processing hubs of the brain during resting-state. Obtained results were subjected to ANOVA test and multiple-comparison post-hoc correction procedure. Results. Outcomes showed that graph topology was not significantly different between PD and healthy groups during the eyes-closed condition, while in the eyes-open condition, statistically significant differences were found. The main effect of levodopa medication was observed for gamma-band activity in which levodopa changed the brain connectome toward a star-like topology. Considering the beta subband of EEG data, graph leaf number increased following levodopa medication in PD patients. Enhanced brain connectivity in the gamma band and reduced beta band connections in the basal ganglia were also observed after levodopa medication. Furthermore, source localization using dipole fitting showed that levodopa suppressed the activity of collateral trigone. Conclusion. Our combined EEG and graph analysis showed that levodopa medication changed the brain connectome, especially in the high-frequency range of brain electrical activities (beta and gamma).},

	abstract = {The dynamics of neuronal systems are characterized by hallmark features such as oscillations and synchrony. However, it has remained unclear whether these characteristics are epiphenomena or are exploited for computation. Due to the challenge of selectively interfering with oscillatory network dynamics in neuronal systems, we simulated recurrent networks of damped harmonic oscillators in which oscillatory activity is enforced in each node, a choice well supported by experimental findings. When trained on standard pattern recognition tasks, these harmonic oscillator recurrent networks (HORNs) outperformed nonoscillatory architectures with respect to learning speed, noise tolerance, and parameter efficiency. HORNs also reproduced a many characteristic features of neuronal systems, such as the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In trained HORNs, stimulus-induced interference patterns holistically represent the result of comparing sensory evidence with priors stored in recurrent connection weights, and learning-induced weight changes are compatible with Hebbian principles. Implementing additional features characteristic of natural networks, such as heterogeneous oscillation frequencies, inhomogeneous conduction delays, and network modularity, further enhanced HORN performance without requiring additional parameters. Taken together, our model allows us to give plausible a posteriori explanations for features of natural networks whose computational role has remained elusive. We conclude that neuronal systems are likely to exploit the unique dynamics of recurrent oscillator networks whose computational superiority critically depends on the oscillatory patterning of their nodal dynamics. Implementing the proposed computational principles in analog hardware is expected to enable the design of highly energy-efficient and self-adapting devices that could ideally complement existing digital technologies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTProgressive decrease in neuronal function is an established feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that amyloid β (Aβ) peptide induces acute increase in spontaneous synaptic activity accompanied by neurotoxicity, and Aβ induces excitotoxic neuronal death by increasing calcium influx mediated by hyperactive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors. An in vivo study has revealed subpopulations of hyperactive neurons near Aβ plaques in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can be normalized by an AMPA receptor antagonist. In the present study, we aim to determine whether soluble Aβ acutely induces hyperactivity of AMPA receptors by a mechanism involving β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). We found that the soluble Aβ binds to β2AR, and the extracellular N terminus of β2AR is critical for the binding. The binding is required to induce G-protein/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which controls PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1 and β2AR, and AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). β2AR and GluR1 also form a complex comprising postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), PKA and its anchor AKAP150, and protein phosphotase 2A (PP2A). Both the third intracellular (i3) loop and C terminus of β2AR are required for the β2AR/AMPA receptor complex. Aβ acutely induces PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 in the complex without affecting the association between two receptors. The present study reveals that non-neurotransmitter Aβ has a binding capacity to β2AR and induces PKA-dependent hyperactivity in AMPA receptors.—Wang, D., Govindaiah, G., Liu, R., De Arcangelis, V., Cox, C.

	abstract = {Physical activity decreases the risk of a network of diseases, and exercise may be prescribed as medicine for lifestyle-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. During the past couple of decades, it has been apparent that skeletal muscle works as an endocrine organ, which can produce and secrete hundreds of myokines that exert their effects in either autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manners. Recent advances show that skeletal muscle produces myokines in response to exercise, which allow for crosstalk between the muscle and other organs, including brain, adipose tissue, bone, liver, gut, pancreas, vascular bed, and skin, as well as communication within the muscle itself. Although only few myokines have been allocated to a specific function in humans, it has been identified that the biological roles of myokines include effects on, for example, cognition, lipid and glucose metabolism, browning of white fat, bone formation, endothelial cell function, hypertrophy, skin structure, and tumor growth. This suggests that myokines may be useful biomarkers for monitoring exercise prescription for people with, for example, cancer, diabetes, or neurodegenerative diseases.},

A crucial component of this generalization behavior is our ability to compose/decompose a whole into reusable parts, an attribute known as compositionality. One of the fundamental questions in robotics concerns this characteristic: How can linguistic compositionality be developed concomitantly with sensorimotor skills through associative learning, particularly when individuals only learn partial linguistic compositions and their corresponding sensorimotor patterns? To address this question, we propose a brain-inspired neural network model that integrates vision, proprioception, and language into a framework of predictive coding and active inference on the basis of the free-energy principle. The effectiveness and capabilities of this model were assessed through various simulation experiments conducted with a robot arm. Our results show that generalization in learning to unlearned verb-noun compositions is significantly enhanced when training variations of task composition are increased. We attribute this to self-organized compositional structures in linguistic latent state space being influenced substantially by sensorimotor learning. Ablation studies show that visual attention and working memory are essential to accurately generate visuomotor sequences to achieve linguistically represented goals. These insights advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying development of compositionality through interactions of linguistic and sensorimotor experience.},

	abstract = {The segmentation of structural MRI data is an essential step for deriving geometrical information about brain tissues. One important application is in transcranial electrical stimulation (e.g., tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique where head modeling is required to determine the electric field (E-field) generated in the cortex to predict and optimize its effects. Here we propose a deep learning-based model (StarNEt) to automatize white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) segmentation and compare its performance with FreeSurfer, an established tool. Since good definition of sulci and gyri in the cortical surface is an important requirement for E-field calculation, StarNEt is specifically designed to output masks at a higher resolution than that of the original input T1w-MRI. StarNEt uses a residual network as the encoder (ResNet) and a fully convolutional neural network with U-net skip connections as the decoder to segment an MRI slice by slice. Slice vertical location is provided as an extra input. The model was trained on scans from 425 patients in the open-access ADNI+IXI datasets, and using FreeSurfer segmentation as ground truth. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice Coefficient (DC) in a separate subset (N=105) of ADNI+IXI and in two extra testing sets not involved in training. In addition, FreeSurfer and StarNEt were compared to manual segmentations of the MRBrainS18 dataset, also unseen by the model. To study performance in real use cases, first, we created electrical head models derived from the FreeSurfer and StarNEt segmentations and used them for montage optimization with a common target region using a standard algorithm (Stimweaver) and second, we used StarNEt to successfully segment the brains of minimally conscious state (MCS) patients having suffered from brain trauma, a scenario where FreeSurfer typically fails. Our results indicate that StarNEt matches FreeSurfer performance on the trained tasks while reducing computation time from several hours to a few seconds, and with the potential to evolve into an effective technique even when patients present large brain abnormalities.},

One approach to identify plausible candidates is to assess whether existing medications for other conditions may affect dementia risk. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies adopting a data-driven approach to investigate the association between a wide range of prescribed medications and dementia risk. We included 14 studies using administrative or medical records data for more than 130 million individuals and 1 million dementia cases. Despite inconsistencies in identifying specific drugs that may modify Alzheimer's or dementia risk, some themes emerged for drug classes with biological plausibility. Antimicrobials, vaccinations, and anti-inflammatories were associated with reduced risk, while diabetes drugs, vitamins and supplements, and antipsychotics were associated with increased risk. We found conflicting evidence for antihypertensives and antidepressants. Drug repurposing for use in dementia is an urgent priority. Our findings offer a basis for prioritizing candidates and exploring underlying mechanisms. Highlights ·We present a systematic review of studies reporting association between drugs prescribed for other conditions and risk of dementia including 139 million people and 1 million cases of dementia. ·Our work supports some previously reported associations, for example, showing decreased risk of dementia with drugs to treat inflammatory disease and increased risk with antipsychotic treatment. ·Antimicrobial treatment was perhaps more surprisingly associated with decreased risk, supportive of recent increased interest in this potential therapeutic avenue. ·Our work should help prioritize drugs for entry into adaptive platform trials in Alzheimer's disease and will serve as a useful resource for those investigating drugs or classes of drugs and risk of dementia.},

Pharmacologically diverse antidepressant drugs increase the synthesis of BDNF in the cortex (and some subcortical structures) and this effect accounts for their ability to facilitate neurotrophic processes eventually leading into heightened plasticity within the cortex. Induction of BDNF-TrkB signaling has also been associated with the mechanism of action of ketamine and more recently with some other anesthetics, even with ones not thought to possess antidepressant potential. Notably, both ketamine and conventional antidepressants activate TrkB receptor and its downstream signaling rapidly within the same time scale in the brain while electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), among the most potent inducers of BDNF, has not been unequivocally shown to produce such acute effects on TrkB. The ability of antidepressants to regulate TrkB signaling is developmentally regulated and requires an intact central nervous system. The purpose of this review is to highlight and discuss some of these peculiarities associated with the effects of ketamine and classical antidepressants and BDNF on TrkB signaling.},

	abstract = {The serotonin hypothesis of depression is still influential. We aimed to synthesise and evaluate evidence on whether depression is associated with lowered serotonin concentration or activity in a systematic umbrella review of the principal relevant areas of research. PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched using terms appropriate to each area of research, from their inception until December 2020. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large data-set analyses in the following areas were identified: serotonin and serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, concentrations in body fluids; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding; serotonin transporter (SERT) levels measured by imaging or at post-mortem; tryptophan depletion studies; SERT gene associations and SERT gene-environment interactions. Studies of depression associated with physical conditions and specific subtypes of depression (e.g. bipolar depression) were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of included studies using the AMSTAR-2, an adapted AMSTAR-2, or the STREGA for a large genetic study. The certainty of study results was assessed using a modified version of the GRADE. We did not synthesise results of individual meta-analyses because they included overlapping studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020207203). 17 studies were included: 12 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 1 collaborative meta-analysis, 1 meta-analysis of large cohort studies, 1 systematic review and narrative synthesis, 1 genetic association study and 1 umbrella review. Quality of reviews was variable with some genetic studies of high quality. Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, showed no association with depression (largest n = 1002). One meta-analysis of cohort studies of plasma serotonin showed no relationship with depression, and evidence that lowered serotonin concentration was associated with antidepressant use (n = 1869). Two meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining the 5-HT1A receptor (largest n = 561), and three meta-analyses of overlapping studies examining SERT binding (largest n = 1845) showed weak and inconsistent evidence of reduced binding in some areas, which would be consistent with increased synaptic availability of serotonin in people with depression, if this was the original, causal abnormaly. However, effects of prior antidepressant use were not reliably excluded. One meta-analysis of tryptophan depletion studies found no effect in most healthy volunteers (n = 566), but weak evidence of an effect in those with a family history of depression (n = 75). Another systematic review (n = 342) and a sample of ten subsequent studies (n = 407) found no effect in volunteers. No systematic review of tryptophan depletion studies has been performed since 2007. The two largest and highest quality studies of the SERT gene, one genetic association study (n = 115,257) and one collaborative meta-analysis (n = 43,165), revealed no evidence of an association with depression, or of an interaction between genotype, stress and depression. The main areas of serotonin research provide no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression, and no support for the hypothesis that depression is caused by lowered serotonin activity or concentrations. Some evidence was consistent with the possibility that long-term antidepressant use reduces serotonin concentration.},

	abstract = {The serotonin deficit hypothesis explanation for major depressive disorder (MDD) has persisted among clinicians and the general public alike despite insufficient supporting evidence. To combat rising mental health crises and eroding public trust in science and medicine, researchers and clinicians must be able to communicate to patients and the public an updated framework of MDD: one that is (1) accessible to a general audience, (2) accurately integrates current evidence about the efficacy of conventional serotonergic antidepressants with broader and deeper understandings of pathophysiology and treatment, and (3) capable of accommodating new evidence. In this article, we summarize a framework for the pathophysiology and treatment of MDD that is informed by clinical and preclinical research in psychiatry and neuroscience. First, we discuss how MDD can be understood as inflexibility in cognitive and emotional brain circuits that involves a persistent negativity bias. Second, we discuss how effective treatments for MDD enhance mechanisms of neuroplasticity—including via serotonergic interventions—to restore synaptic, network, and behavioral function in ways that facilitate adaptive cognitive and emotional processing. These treatments include typical monoaminergic antidepressants, novel antidepressants like ketamine and psychedelics, and psychotherapy and neuromodulation techniques. At the end of the article, we discuss this framework from the perspective of effective science communication and provide useful language and metaphors for researchers, clinicians, and other professionals discussing MDD with a general or patient audience.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty regarding which psychological mechanisms are fundamental in mediating SSRI treatment outcomes and wide-ranging variability in their efficacy has raised more questions than it has solved. Since subjective mood states are an abstract scientific construct, only available through self-report in humans, and likely involving input from multiple top-down and bottom-up signals, it has been difficult to model at what level SSRIs interact with this process. Converging translational evidence indicates a role for serotonin in modulating context-dependent parameters of action selection, affect, and social cognition; and concurrently supporting learning mechanisms, which promote adaptability and behavioural flexibility. We examine the theoretical basis, ecological validity, and interaction of these constructs and how they may or may not exert a clinical benefit. Specifically, we bridge crucial gaps between disparate lines of research, particularly findings from animal models and human clinical trials, which often seem to present irreconcilable differences. In determining how SSRIs exert their effects, our approach examines the endogenous functions of 5-HT neurons, how 5-HT manipulations affect behaviour in different contexts, and how their therapeutic effects may be exerted in humans – which may illuminate issues of translational models, hierarchical mechanisms, idiographic variables, and social cognition.},

	abstract = {Background
The serotonin hypothesis of depression proposes that diminished serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission is causal in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Although the hypothesis is over 50 years old, there is no firm in vivo evidence for diminished 5-HT neurotransmission. We recently demonstrated that the 5-HT2A receptor agonist positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]Cimbi-36 is sensitive to increases in extracellular 5-HT induced by an acute d-amphetamine challenge. Here we applied [11C]Cimbi-36 PET to compare brain 5-HT release capacity in patients experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE) to that of healthy control subjects (HCs) without depression.
Methods
Seventeen antidepressant-free patients with MDE (3 female/14 male, mean age 44 ± 13 years, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score 21 ± 4 [range 16–30]) and 20 HCs (3 female/17 male, mean age 32 ± 9 years) underwent 90-minute dynamic [11C]Cimbi-36 PET before and 3 hours after a 0.5-mg/kg oral dose of d-amphetamine. Frontal cortex (main region of interest) 5-HT2A receptor nondisplaceable binding was calculated from kinetic analysis using the multilinear analysis-1 approach with the cerebellum as the reference region.
Results
Following d-amphetamine administration, frontal nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was significantly reduced in the HC group (1.04 ± 0.31 vs. 0.87 ± 0.24, p {\textless} .001) but not in the MDE group (0.97 ± 0.25 vs. 0.92 ± 0.22, not significant). ΔBPND of the MDE group was significantly lower than that of the HC group (HC: 15\% ± 14\% vs. MDE: 6.5\% ± 20\%, p = .041).
Conclusions
This first direct assessment of 5-HT release capacity in people with depression provides clear evidence for dysfunctional serotonergic neurotransmission in depression by demonstrating reduced 5-HT release capacity in patients experiencing an MDE.},

	abstract = {Ketamine, a dissociative compound, shows promise in treating mood disorders, including treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Despite its therapeutic potential, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying ketamine’s effects are not fully understood. This study explored acute neurophysiological changes induced by subanesthetic doses of ketamine in BD patients with depression using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers. A cohort of 30 BD (F = 12) inpatients with TRD undergoing ketamine treatment was included in the study. EEG recordings were performed during one of the ketamine infusions with doses ranging from 0.5 to 1 mg/kg, and subjective effects were evaluated using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Both rhythmic and arrhythmic features were extrapolated from the EEG signal. Patients who exhibited a clinical response to ketamine treatment within one week were classified as early responders (ER), whereas those who responded later were categorized as late responders (LR). Ketamine reduced low-frequency spectral power density while increasing gamma oscillatory power. Additionally, ketamine flattened the slope of the power spectra, indicating altered scale-free dynamics. Ketamine also increased brain signal entropy, particularly in high-frequency bands. Notably, LR exhibited greater EEG changes compared to ER, suggesting endophenotypic differences in treatment sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights into the neurophysiological effects of ketamine in BD depression, highlighting the utility of EEG biomarkers for assessing ketamine’s therapeutic mechanisms in real-world clinical settings. Understanding the neural correlates of ketamine response may contribute to personalized treatment approaches and improved management of mood disorders.},

In earlier work [1, 2], we implemented support vector machine classifiers (SVMs) using EEG mean spectral features to predict the course of disease in the dual HC vs. PD problem with an accuracy of 85 \%. Although largely successful, this approach did not attempt to exploit the non-linear dynamic characteristics of EEG signals, which are believed to contain useful information. Here we describe an Echo State Network (ESN) classifier capable of processing the dynamic features of EEG power at different spectral bands. The inputs to the classifier are the time series of 1 second-averaged EEG power at several selected frequencies and channels. The performance of the ESN reaches 85 \% test-set accuracy in the HC vs. PD problem using the same subset of channels and bands we selected in our prior work on this problem using SVMs.},

There was a marked increase in the fractions of both silent and hyperactive neurons, as previously also found in the cortex. Remarkably, in the hippocampus of young mice, we observed a selective increase in hyperactive neurons already before the formation of plaques, suggesting that soluble species of Aβ may underlie this impairment. Indeed, we found that acute treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor LY-411575 reduces soluble Aβ levels and rescues the neuronal dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that direct application of soluble Aβ can induce neuronal hyperactivity in wild-type mice. Thus, our study identifies hippocampal hyperactivity as a very early functional impairment in AD transgenic mice and provides direct evidence that soluble Aβ is crucial for hippocampal hyperactivity.},

Although extensive researches have been conducted on the effects of different amyloid conformations such as oligomers and fibrils on neuronal function in isolated cells and circuits, the exact contribution of extracellular beta-amyloid on neurons remains incompletely comprehended. In our experiments, we studied the effect of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ1–42) on the action potential (APs) generation in isolated CA1 hippocampal neurons in perforated patch clamp conditions. Our findings demonstrate that Aβ1–42 affects the generation of APs differently in various hippocampal neurons, albeit with a shared effect of enhancing the firing response of the neurons within a minute of the start of Aβ1–42 application. In the first response type, there was a shift of 20–65\% toward smaller values in the firing threshold of action potentials in response to inward current. Conversely, the firing threshold of action potentials was not affected in the second type of response to the application of Aβ1–42. In these neurons, Aβ1-42 caused a moderate increase in the frequency of spiking, up to 15\%, with a relatively uniform increase in the frequency of action potentials generation regardless of the level of input current. Obtained data prove the absence of direct short-term negative effect of the Aβ1–42 on APs generation in neurons. Even with increasing the APs generation frequency and lowering the neurons’ activation threshold, neurons were functional. Obtained data can suggest that only the long-acting presence of the Aβ1–42 in the cell environment can cause neuronal dysfunction due to a prolonged increase of APs firing and predisposition to this process.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Specifically, the Rao-Ballard hierarchical predictive coding model assumes that the top-down feedback connections from higher to lower order cortical areas convey predictions of lower-level activities. The bottom-up, feedforward connections in turn convey the errors between top-down predictions and actual activities. These errors are used to correct current estimates of the state of the world and generate new predictions.

In these studies, fMRI data was collected in response to negative stimuli during cognitive-emotional tasks before and after psychotherapy. Post-psychotherapy, activation decreased in the right insula, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; no region had increased activation. A subgroup analysis for CBT revealed additional decrease in the supplementary motor area. Reduced activation in limbic and frontal regions might indicate therapy-associated normalization regarding the perception of internal and external threat, subsequent allocation of cognitive resources, and changes in cognitive control.

The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool-2 was used to assess study quality. Response rate was the primary outcome measure. Odds ratios (ORs) using a random effects NMA are reported. From 8234 records, 69 RCTs were included in this analysis, encompassing 10,285 participants (5662 F/4623 M) and 25 separate treatments. Six of the 25 treatments demonstrated a higher response rate versus placebo or sham treatment: electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), minocycline, theta-burst stimulation (TBS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), ketamine, and aripiprazole. ORs ranged from 1.9 (95\%CI = [1.25; 2.91]) for aripiprazole to 12.86 (95\%CI = [4.07; 40.63]) for ECT. Moderate heterogeneity of the model was observed (I2 = 47.3\% (95\%CI [26.8–62\%]). Of the included studies, 12.5\% were rated as having high risk of bias, 28.13\% as having low risk, and 59.38\% as showing some concerns. Several effective treatments for TRD showed robust treatment effects across outcomes (ECT, TBS, rTMS, and ketamine), and others showed promising results for some, but not all, outcomes (minocycline, aripiprazole). These findings may help guide evidence-based treatment choices for TRD. Study Registration: PROSPERO (\#CRD42023420584).},

	abstract = {Symmetries (transformations by group actions) are present in many datasets, and leveraging them holds significant promise for improving predictions in machine learning. In this work, we aim to understand when and how deep networks can learn symmetries from data. We focus on a supervised classification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed during training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group, while others include only a subset. We ask: can deep networks generalize symmetry invariance to the partially sampled classes? In the infinite-width limit, where kernel analogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning to address this question. The group-cyclic nature of the dataset allows us to analyze the spectrum of neural kernels in the Fourier domain; here we find a simple characterization of the generalization error as a function of the interaction between class separation (signal) and class-orbit density (noise). We observe that generalization can only be successful when the local structure of the data prevails over its non-local, symmetric, structure, in the kernel space defined by the architecture. This occurs when (1) classes are sufficiently distinct and (2) class orbits are sufficiently dense. Our framework also applies to equivariant architectures (e.g., CNNs), and recovers their success in the special case where the architecture matches the inherent symmetry of the data. Empirically, our theory reproduces the generalization failure of finite-width networks (MLP, CNN, ViT) trained on partially observed versions of rotated-MNIST. We conclude that conventional networks trained with supervision lack a mechanism to learn symmetries that have not been explicitly embedded in their architecture a priori. Our framework could be extended to guide the design of architectures and training procedures able to learn symmetries from data.},

We show that even for simple forms of these equations, there are parameter regimes in which the interaction causes the system to stop oscillating, and the rest state at zero, stabilized by the interaction, is the only stable solution. When the uncoupled oscillators have a local frequency that is independent of amplitude (zero shear), and the coupling is scalar, we give a complete description of the behavior. We then analyze more complicated equations to show the effects of amplitude-dependent frequency in the uncoupled equations (nonzero shear) and nonscalar coupling. For example, when there is shear, there can be bistability between a phase-locked solution and an unlocked “drift” solution, in which the oscillators go at different average frequencies. There can also be bistability between a phase locked solution and an equilibrium, nonoscillatory, solution. The equations for the zero shear case have a pair of degenerate bifurcation points, and the new phenomena in the nonzero shear case arise from a partial unfolding of these singularities. When the coupling is nonscalar, there are a variety of new behaviors, including bistability of an in-phase and an anti-phase solution for two identical oscillators, parameters for which only the anti-phase solution is stable, and “phase-trapping,” i.e. nonlocked solutions in which the oscillators still have the same average frequency. It is shown that whether the coupling is diffusive or direct has many effects on the behavior of the system.},

	abstract = {Depression constitutes a pervasive global mental health concern and stands as a principal determinant of elevated suicide rates worldwide. Recent empirical investigations have showcased the significant potential of visual art therapy (VAT) in ameliorating symptoms among individuals with depression. Nevertheless, specific studies have yielded findings marked by inconclusiveness, underscoring the imperative need for further research to comprehensively establish its efficacy. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of extant research, to ascertain the efficacy and effect size of VAT as an intervention for adults with depressive symptoms. A comprehensive search was conducted across 10 databases. The search encompassed articles published from the inception of these databases up until October 18, 2023. Two researchers screened the literature in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed a thorough quality assessment. The original data and the data obtained from the literature were extracted for further analysis. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using Stata 17.0 software. fifteen studies were included, encompassing a total of 932 participants. The outcomes of meta-analysis unveiled a statistically significant effect of VAT in diminishing depressive symptoms among adults (SMD = -0.73; 95\% CI, -1.07 to -0.39; p {\textless} 0.001; 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs); low-quality evidence). The subgroup analysis indicated that VAT exhibited heightened effectiveness among adults below 65 years of age, with interventions lasting ≤12 weeks demonstrating superior efficacy. Additionally, sensitivity analysis underscored the robustness and reliability of the findings. VAT appears to alleviate depressive symptoms among adults. Existing research indicates that the effectiveness of VAT is influenced by factors, such as intervention population characteristics and intervention duration. However, to comprehensively probe the efficacy of VAT, future studies should strive for larger sample sizes, multicentre collaborations, and long-term follow-ups.},

	abstract = {Background: Conventional transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) regimens are logistically burdensome, requiring days or weeks of clinic visits. Here we describe a TMS regimen enabling delivery of an entire therapeutic course in a single day.
Methods: This retrospective case series reports outcomes for an optimized, neuroplastogen-enhanced depression (ONE-D) treatment regimen delivering 600-pulse iTBS (120\% MT) targeting left DLPFC via scalp heuristic, every 30 minutes for 20 sessions in 9.5 hours, enhancing neuroplasticity via single-dose d-cycloserine (125 mg) and lisdexamfetamine (20 mg), off-label, given 1 hour pre-treatment. 32 TMS-eligible adults with medication-resistant unipolar depression underwent the ONE-D regimen, with assessments on day-of-treatment then weekly x 6 weeks (HDRS-17, BDI-II, PHQ-9, and GAD-7).
Results: Every patient completed the regimen successfully, with no serious adverse events (mean scalp discomfort, 5.8±2.1/10). Response was not immediate but followed an exponential-decay trajectory over the 6-week followup: mean weekly scores of 22.6±5.3(baseline), 13.5±6.4, 10.6±6.4, 7.9±4.9, 6.6±4.9, 6.3±4.8, 5.5±4.2 (HDRS-17), 37.5±9.0(baseline), 23.8±12.2, 17.1±11.1, 14.1±11.2, 11.0±8.7, 9.5±8.2, 7.6±7.8 (BDI-II,) 18.4±3.5(baseline), 11.4±5.1, 9.4±5.7, 6.9±5.2, 6.0±3.9, 5.3±4.0, 4.6±4.2 (PHQ-9), 14.3±5.2(baseline), 8.7±4.5, 6.4±5.0, 4.3±4.0, 3.8±3.6, 3.3±3.3, 3.1±2.7 (GAD-7). Response / remission rates (cross-sectional, not aggregated) were 90.3\% and 74.2\% (HDRS-17), 93.5\% and 71.0\% (BDI-II), 90.3\% and 58.1\% (PHQ-9), 93.3\% and 76.7\% (GAD-7) at week 6, and 92.6\% and 77.8\% (HDRS-17), 92.3\% and 73.1\% (BDI-II), 86.4\% and 65.4\% (PHQ-9), 91.7\% and 80.0\% (GAD-7) at week 12.
Conclusion: Delivery of an effective TMS course in one day appears feasible, safe, and well-tolerated. With neuroplastogen-enhancement, despite non-personalized, scalp-based targeting, the response and remission rates appeared robust and sustained in representative clinical populations. Follow-up studies may allow further acceleration of the regimen and generalization to other TMS indications.},

Among the many elicitors identified as being able to foster TEs, an emerging body of literature has suggested that TEs might be prevalent in aesthetics or emerged from encounters with human art. Beyond denoting ordinary moments characterizing our daily lives, art and aesthetics could occasionally represent profound changes, causing shifts in our perceptions, beliefs and understanding of the world. However, in the realm of psychological inquiry, the extent to which art and aesthetics can be considered potential catalysts for transformation remains a topic of debate.

	abstract = {The classical frequency bands of the EEG can be described as a geometric series with a ratio (between neighbouring frequencies) of 1.618, which is the golden mean. Here we show that a synchronization of the excitatory phases of two oscillations with frequencies f1 and f2 is impossible (in a mathematical sense) when their ratio equals the golden mean, because their excitatory phases never meet. Thus, in a mathematical sense, the golden mean provides a totally uncoupled (‘desynchronized’) processing state which most likely reflects a ‘resting’ brain, which is not involved in selective information processing. However, excitatory phases of the f1- and f2-oscillations occasionally come close enough to coincide in a physiological sense. These coincidences are more frequent, the higher the frequencies f1 and f2. We demonstrate that the pattern of excitatory phase meetings provided by the golden mean as the ‘most irrational’ number is least frequent and most irregular. Thus, in a physiological sense, the golden mean provides (i) the highest physiologically possible desynchronized state in the resting brain, (ii) the possibility for spontaneous and most irregular (!) coupling and uncoupling between rhythms and (iii) the opportunity for a transition from resting state to activity. These characteristics have already been discussed to lay the ground for a healthy interplay between various physiological processes (Buchmann, 2002).},

	abstract = {The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened three separate work groups in 2011 and single work groups in 2012 and 2018 to create recommendations for the diagnosis and characterization of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present document updates the 2018 research framework in response to several recent developments. Defining diseases biologically, rather than based on syndromic presentation, has long been standard in many areas of medicine (e.g., oncology), and is becoming a unifying concept common to all neurodegenerative diseases, not just AD. The present document is consistent with this principle. Our intent is to present objective criteria for diagnosis and staging AD, incorporating recent advances in biomarkers, to serve as a bridge between research and clinical care. These criteria are not intended to provide step-by-step clinical practice guidelines for clinical workflow or specific treatment protocols, but rather serve as general principles to inform diagnosis and staging of AD that reflect current science. Highlights We define Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be a biological process that begins with the appearance of AD neuropathologic change (ADNPC) while people are asymptomatic. Progression of the neuropathologic burden leads to the later appearance and progression of clinical symptoms. Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET], approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and accurate plasma biomarkers [especially phosphorylated tau 217]) map onto either the amyloid beta or AD tauopathy pathway; however, these reflect the presence of ADNPC more generally (i.e., both neuritic plaques and tangles). An abnormal Core 1 biomarker result is sufficient to establish a diagnosis of AD and to inform clinical decision making throughout the disease continuum. Later-changing Core 2 biomarkers (biofluid and tau PET) can provide prognostic information, and when abnormal, will increase confidence that AD is contributing to symptoms. An integrated biological and clinical staging scheme is described that accommodates the fact that common copathologies, cognitive reserve, and resistance may modify relationships between clinical and biological AD stages.},

We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.},

It characterizes equivariance and invariance (a special case of equivariance) of continuous groups using Lie algebra and directly solves the Lie algebra space through the inputs, outputs, and gradients of the trained neural network. Then, we extend the method to make it applicable to multi-channel data and tensor data, respectively. We validate the performance of LieSD on tasks with symmetries such as the two-body problem, the moment of inertia matrix prediction, and top quark tagging. Compared with the baseline, LieSD can accurately determine the number of Lie algebra bases without the need for expensive group sampling. Furthermore, LieSD can perform well on non-uniform datasets, whereas methods based on GANs fail.},

findings. This study provides a comprehensive review of scales designed to assess subjective
time, employing literature analysis and transformer-based natural language processing (NLP)

inclusion criteria were identified, revealing two primary clusters: temporal experience and time
perspective. Temporal experience encompasses diverse dimensions of how individuals
perceive and conceptualize time, while time perspective focuses on orientations toward past,
present, and future. Hierarchical clustering and semantic analysis highlighted overlaps and
distinctions. Our findings underscore recurring challenges in differentiating between
theoretically distinct constructs, such as temporal orientation and time perspective, due to
significant overlap in operationalizations. Furthermore, discrepancies between theoretical
definitions and scale content emphasize the importance of scrutinizing alignment to ensure
validity. Automated semantic analysis offers a valuable tool for identifying redundancy and
improving measurement clarity, particularly given the proliferation of self-report measures in
psychology. However, methodological variations and domain expertise are crucial to
interpreting results meaningfully. This study demonstrates the utility of NLP in advancing the

Yet, today\&amp;rsquo;s means for measuring changes in subjective experience are mostly limited to legacy questionnaires of pre-assumed relevance, which could be complemented by bottom-up explorations of semantic facets that underlie experience reports.

Investigator-independent LLM scoring of these drug effects on the human mind alone allowed to robustly discriminate the unique mental effects of 30 psychoactive substances.

            This chapter focuses on the structure of experience, covering language, objects, scenes, and events. It is argued that partitioning the world is the first step to comprehending it. Some partitioning is so instantaneous and automatic that perception of the world is not of multimedia mixtures of continuously changing sensations but rather of coherent objects, events, and scenes. The mind goes on to parse those elements and to look for structure among the parts. Typically there is a perceptual basis for part structure. Truly understanding each of these elements of our lives requires assigning meaning to their parts.},

However, while the methodology structures and documents the points at which design decisions are made, it does not provide a specific, quantitative basis for making these decisions. Typically, the designers' only guidelines are qualitative, perhaps even vague, principles such as "functionality," "data transparency," or "clarity." This paper, like several recent publications, defines and validates a set of software metrics which are appropriate for evaluating the structure of large-scale systems. These metrics are based on the measurement of information flow between system components. Specific metrics are defined for procedure complexity, module complexity, and module coupling. The validation, using the source code for the UNIX operating system, shows that the complexity measures are strongly correlated with the occurrence of changes. Further, the metrics for procedures and modules can be interpreted to reveal various types of structural flaws in the design and implementation.},

Many studies have observed arousal-related modulations of alpha ({\textasciitilde}8 to 15 Hz) and gamma ({\textasciitilde}30 to 50 Hz) power and coherence in local field potentials across relatively small groups of brain regions. However, the global pattern of arousal-related oscillatory modulation in local field potentials is yet to be fully elucidated. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in numerous cortical and subcortical regions in the primate brain and assessed oscillatory activity and inter-regional coherence associated with arousal state. In high arousal states, we found a uniquely strong and coherent gamma oscillation between the amygdala and basal forebrain. In low arousal rest-like states, a relative increase in coherence at alpha frequencies was present across sampled brain regions, with the notable exception of the medial temporal lobe. We consider how these patterns of activity may index arousal-related brain states that support the processing of incoming sensory stimuli during high arousal states and memory-related functions during rest.},

Leveraging large-scale intracellular electrophysiological data, we relate the spiking reliability of cortical neurons in-vitro during the intracellular injection of current resembling synaptic inputs to their morphologic, electrophysiologic, and transcriptomic classes. Our findings demonstrate that parvalbumin+ (PV) interneurons, a subclass of inhibitory neurons, show high reliability compared to other neuronal subclasses, particularly excitatory neurons. Through computational modeling, we predict that the high reliability of PV interneurons allows for strong and precise inhibition in downstream neurons, while the lower reliability of excitatory neurons allows for integrating multiple synaptic inputs leading to a spiking rate code. These findings illuminate how spiking variability in different neuronal classes affect information propagation in the brain, leading to precise inhibition and spiking rate codes.},

This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to departure from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperaturelike variable that restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily non-negative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.},

Among these, the Dynamic Mean Field (DMF) model is particularly attractive, combining a biophysically realistic model that is scaled up via a mean-field approach and multimodal imaging data. However, an important barrier to the widespread usage of the DMF model is that current implementations are computationally expensive, supporting only simulations on brain parcellations that consider less than 100 brain regions. Here, we introduce an efficient and accessible implementation of the DMF model: the FastDMF. By leveraging analytical and numerical advances—including a novel estimation of the feedback inhibition control parameter and a Bayesian optimization algorithm—the FastDMF circumvents various computational bottlenecks of previous implementations, improving interpretability, performance, and memory use. Furthermore, these advances allow the FastDMF to increase the number of simulated regions by one order of magnitude, as confirmed by the good fit to fMRI data parcellated at 90 and 1,000 regions. These advances open the way to the widespread use of biophysically grounded whole-brain models for investigating the interplay between anatomy, function, and brain dynamics and to identify mechanistic explanations of recent results obtained from fine-grained neuroimaging recordings.},

Second, we describe the NLP pipeline and explain the underlying modelling approaches (for example, dictionary-based approaches and large language models). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for behavioural science, in particular with respect to the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Finally, we provide actionable recommendations for using NLP to ensure rigour and reproducibility.

Here, we propose a potential path past this roadblock, by leveraging a common ingredient of most mental disorders: impaired cognitive control. We previously showed that deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves cognitive control in humans. We now reverse translate that result using a set-shifting task in rats. DBS-like stimulation of the midstriatum improved reaction times without affecting accuracy, mirroring our human findings. Impulsivity, motivation, locomotor, and learning effects were ruled out through companion tasks and model-based analyses. To identify the specific cognitive processes affected, we applied reinforcement learning drift-diffusion modeling. This approach revealed that DBS-like stimulation enhanced evidence accumulation rates and lowered decision thresholds, improving domain-general cognitive control. Reanalysis of prior human data showed that the same mechanism applies in humans. This reverse/forward translational model could have near-term implications for clinical DBS practice and future trial design.},

However, the readiness of these models for real-world clinical application remains inadequately tested. This paper introduces the Conversational Reasoning Assessment Framework for Testing in Medicine (CRAFT-MD) approach for evaluating clinical LLMs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on structured medical examinations, CRAFT-MD focuses on natural dialogues, using simulated artificial intelligence agents to interact with LLMs in a controlled environment. We applied CRAFT-MD to assess the diagnostic capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mistral and LLaMA-2-7b across 12 medical specialties. Our experiments revealed critical insights into the limitations of current LLMs in terms of clinical conversational reasoning, history-taking and diagnostic accuracy. These limitations also persisted when analyzing multimodal conversational and visual assessment capabilities of GPT-4V. We propose a comprehensive set of recommendations for future evaluations of clinical LLMs based on our empirical findings. These recommendations emphasize realistic doctor–patient conversations, comprehensive history-taking, open-ended questioning and using a combination of automated and expert evaluations. The introduction of CRAFT-MD marks an advancement in testing of clinical LLMs, aiming to ensure that these models augment medical practice effectively and ethically. By simulating realistic doctor–patient conversations, a framework can be applied to large language models to investigate shortcomings and bias in patient interactions, providing insight before actual clinical deployment.},

We estimate emotion semantics across a sample of 2474 spoken languages using “colexification”—a phenomenon in which languages name semantically related concepts with the same word. Analyses show significant variation in networks of emotion concept colexification, which is predicted by the geographic proximity of language families. We also find evidence of universal structure in emotion colexification networks, with all families differentiating emotions primarily on the basis of hedonic valence and physiological activation.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Classic psychedelics are substances of paramount cultural and neuroscientific importance. A distinctive feature of psychedelic drugs is the wide range of potential subjective effects they can elicit, known to be deeply influenced by the internal state of the user (“set”) and the surroundings (“setting”). The observation of cross-tolerance and a series of empirical studies in humans and animal models support agonism at the serotonin (5-HT)$_{\textrm{2A}}$ receptor as a common mechanism for the action of psychedelics. The diversity of subjective effects elicited by different compounds has been attributed to the variables of “set” and “setting,” to the binding affinities for other 5-HT receptor subtypes, and to the heterogeneity of transduction pathways initiated by conformational receptor states as they interact with different ligands (“functional selectivity”). Here we investigate the complementary (i.e., not mutually exclusive) possibility that such variety is also related to the binding affinity for a range of neurotransmitters and monoamine transporters including (but not limited to) 5-HT receptors. Building on two independent binding affinity datasets (compared to “{\textless}italic{\textgreater}in silico{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}” estimates) in combination with natural language processing tools applied to a large repository of reports of psychedelic experiences (Erowid’s Experience Vaults), we obtained preliminary evidence supporting that the similarity between the binding affinity profiles of psychoactive substituted phenethylamines and tryptamines is correlated with the semantic similarity of the associated reports. We also showed that the highest correlation was achieved by considering the combined binding affinity for the 5-HT, dopamine (DA), glutamate, muscarinic and opioid receptors and for the Ca+ channel. Applying dimensionality reduction techniques to the reports, we linked the compounds, receptors, transporters and the Ca+ channel to distinct fingerprints of the reported subjective effects. To the extent that the existing binding affinity data is based on a low number of displacement curves that requires further replication, our analysis produced preliminary evidence consistent with the involvement of different binding sites in the reported subjective effects elicited by psychedelics. Beyond the study of this particular class of drugs, we provide a methodological framework to explore the relationship between the binding affinity profiles and the reported subjective effects of other psychoactive compounds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We introduce the generalized symmetric information bottleneck (GSIB), which explores different functional forms of the cost of such simultaneous reduction. We then explore the data set size requirements of such simultaneous compression. We do this by deriving bounds and root-mean-squared estimates of statistical fluctuations of the involved loss functions. We show that in typical situations, the simultaneous GSIB compression requires qualitatively less data to achieve the same errors compared to compressing variables one at a time. We suggest that this is an example of a more general principle that simultaneous compression is more data efficient than independent compression of each of the input variables.},

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \${\textbackslash}X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \${\textbackslash}X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \${\textbackslash}Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \${\textbackslash}X\$ provides about \${\textbackslash}Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \${\textbackslash}tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,{\textbackslash}x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \${\textbackslash}X\$ and \${\textbackslash}Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}tX\$ and \${\textbackslash}tX {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.

A natural framework to capture their multiscale nature is that of multilayer networks, where different layers represent distinct physical processes that often regulate each other indirectly. We model these regulatory mechanisms through triadic higher-order interactions between nodes and edges. In this work, we focus on how the different timescales associated with each layer impact their reciprocal effective couplings. First, we rigorously derive a decomposition of the joint probability distribution of any dynamical process acting on such multilayer networks. By inspecting this probabilistic structure, we unravel the general principles governing how information propagates across timescales, elucidating the interplay between mutual information and causality in multiscale systems. In particular, we show that feedback interactions, i.e., those representing regulatory mechanisms from slow to fast variables, generate mutual information between layers. On the contrary, direct interactions, i.e., from fast to slow layers, can propagate this information only under certain conditions that depend solely on the structure of the underlying higher-order couplings. We introduce the mutual information matrix for multiscale observables to capture these emergent functional couplings. We apply our results to study archetypal examples of biological signaling networks and effective environmental dependencies in stochastic processes. Our framework generalizes to any dynamics on multilayer networks, paving the way for a deeper understanding of how the multiscale nature of real-world systems shapes their information content and complexity.},

One example of this critical state is ‘avalanche criticality’, which has been observed in various systems, including cultured neurons, zebrafish, rodent cortex, and human EEG. More recently, power laws were also observed in neural populations in the mouse under an activity coarse-graining procedure, and they were explained as a consequence of the neural activity being coupled to multiple latent dynamical variables. An intriguing possibility is that avalanche criticality emerges due to a similar mechanism. Here, we determine the conditions under which latent dynamical variables give rise to avalanche criticality. We find that populations coupled to multiple latent variables produce critical behavior across a broader parameter range than those coupled to a single, quasi-static latent variable, but in both cases, avalanche criticality is observed without fine-tuning of model parameters. We identify two regimes of avalanches, both critical but differing in the amount of information carried about the latent variable. Our results suggest that avalanche criticality arises in neural systems in which activity is effectively modeled as a population driven by a few dynamical variables and these variables can be inferred from the population activity.},

In order to shed a light on the underlying mechanisms at the origin of these signatures of criticality, we introduce a paradigmatic framework with a common stochastic modulation and pairwise linear interactions inferred from our data. We show that in such models power-law avalanches that satisfy the crackling-noise relation emerge as a consequence of the extrinsic modulation, whereas scale-free correlations are solely determined by internal interactions. Moreover, this disentangling is fully captured by the mutual information in the system. Finally, we show that analogous power-law avalanches are found in more realistic models of neural activity as well, suggesting that extrinsic modulation might be a broad mechanism for their generation.},

	abstract = {The presence of self-organized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a power-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear regression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not necessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first provide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of brain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP peaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not robust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous statistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Similar power-law scaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling may be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next investigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic processes can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of underlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent in logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis such as the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an artificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case, both the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal with no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We conclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law scaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent power-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality, which should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.},

Algorithmic agents operate under limited data access, finite computational resources, and fundamental limits from the algorithmic information theory (AIT). In this paper, we demonstrate how these limitations naturally give rise to the principles of probability, Bayesian inference, and the concept of emergence within this framework.
Using a toy example of an agent compressing data from a large library, we demonstrate how limitations in data access naturally lead to a multi-model strategy, where probabilistic reasoning and Occam's razor emerge as the agent navigates between different models. This process is naturally extended by allowing it to accommodate objective functions beyond compression.  
Next, we propose a formal definition of emergence from the notions of coarse-graining and Kolmogorov complexity. Due to its limited resources, the agent must employ coarse-graining to transform data that initially appears incompressible into a compressible, aggregate form while retaining a non-trivial structure. The agent must find patterns and operate at some coarse-graining level to ensure survival. Coarse-graining may include various forms of data reorganization, such as spatiotemporal averaging, compressive sensing, and dimensionality reduction techniques.
We discuss the connections to other theoretical approaches, such as Jaynes' robot, the Free Energy Principle, and Active Inference. By addressing how an ideal agent copes with the inherent limitations of data access and computational capacity, we provide a unified framework for understanding both probabilistic reasoning and emergence in algorithmic agents.},

It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiology studies propose that predictive coding is implemented via alpha/beta (8-30 Hz) rhythms that prepare specific pathways to process predicted inputs. This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics ({\textasciitilde}{\textless}20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma ({\textasciitilde}40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.},

Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity \$A\$ with an arrow \${\textbackslash}breve\{A\}\_{\textbackslash}phi:{\textbackslash}Si\_{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}map{\textbackslash}R\_{\textbackslash}phi\$ where \${\textbackslash}Si\_{\textbackslash}phi\$ and \${\textbackslash}R\_{\textbackslash}phi\$ are two special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the appropriate topos, \${\textbackslash}tau\_{\textbackslash}phi\$. We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, \$S\$. The first, \${\textbackslash}PL\{S\}\$, is a propositional language; the second, \${\textbackslash}L\{S\}\$, is a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of \${\textbackslash}PL\{S\}\$ we expand and develop some of the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf \${\textbackslash}Sig\$--the topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is \${\textbackslash}SetH\{\}\$: the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially ordered set) \${\textbackslash}V\{\}\$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded operators on the quantum Hilbert space \${\textbackslash}Hi\$.},

	abstract = {Can focal brain lesions, such as those caused by stroke, disrupt critical brain dynamics? What biological mechanisms drive its recovery? In a recent study, we showed that focal lesions generate a sub-critical state that recovers over time in parallel with behavior (Rocha et al., Nat. Commun. 13, 2022). The loss of criticality in a cohort of stroke patients was associated with structural brain disconnections, while its recovery was accompanied by the re-modeling of specific white-matter tracts. These results were challenged by Janarek et al. (Sci. Rep. 13, 2023), who proposed an alternative interpretation for the anomalous monotonic decaying of the second cluster size, which is the neural signature originally used to infer loss of criticality. The present study tackles this controversy and provides evidence that the theoretical framework proposed by Janarek et al. cannot explain the anomalous cluster dynamics observed in our patients. Notably, this invalidates the claim that the brain maintains its critical dynamics regardless of the lesion severity. In addition, we explore biological mechanisms beyond white-matter remodeling that may facilitate the recovery of criticality over time. We considered two distinct scenarios: one where we suppress homeostatic plasticity, and another where we increase the excitability of brain regions. We find that suppressing homeostatic plasticity - specifically, the inhibition-excitation balance - disfavors the emergence of criticality. Conversely, increasing brain excitability can help to restore criticality when the latter is disrupted. Our results suggest that normalizing the excitation-inhibition balance is crucial for supporting recovery of critical brain dynamics.},

This repetition undermines what we can learn from studying individual diagnostic constructs because it can obscure both disorder- and symptom-specific signals. However, these lost opportunities are currently veiled because symptom repetition in the DSM-5 has not been quantified.MethodThis descriptive study mapped the repetition among the 1419 symptoms described in 202 diagnoses of adult psychopathology in section II of the DSM-5. Over a million possible symptom comparisons needed to be conducted, for which we used both qualitative content coding and natural language processing.ResultsIn total, we identified 628 distinct symptoms: 397 symptoms (63.2\%) were unique to a single diagnosis, whereas 231 symptoms (36.8\%) repeated across multiple diagnoses a total of 1022 times (median 3 times per symptom; range 2–22). Some chapters had more repetition than others: For example, every symptom of every diagnosis in the bipolar and related disorders chapter was repeated in other chapters, but there was no repetition for any symptoms of any diagnoses in the elimination disorders, gender dysphoria or paraphilic disorders. The most frequently repeated symptoms included insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability – listed in 22, 17 and 16 diagnoses, respectively. Notably, the top 15 most frequently repeating diagnostic criteria were dominated by symptoms of major depressive disorder.ConclusionOverall, our findings lay the foundation for a better understanding of the extent and potential consequences of symptom overlap.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence is a stress-induced irreversible cell cycle arrest involved in tumor suppression and aging. Many stresses, such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation, induce senescence by damaging nuclear DNA. However, the mechanisms linking DNA damage to senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to mitochondria triggers senescence. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen implicated the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein BNIP3 in senescence induction. We found that BNIP3 is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and contributes to an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae. Stable isotope labeling metabolomics indicated that the increase in cristae enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). This promotes histone acetylation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a. Notably, pharmacological activation of FAO alone induced senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mitochondrial energy metabolism plays a critical role in senescence induction and is a potential intervention target to control senescence.},

Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.},

Here, we develop an approach to profile hair pigmentation patterns (HPPs) along individual human hair shafts, producing quantifiable physical timescales of rapid greying transitions. Results:. Using this method, we show white/grey hairs that naturally regain pigmentation across sex, ethnicities, ages, and body regions, thereby quantitatively defining the reversibility of greying in humans. Molecularly, grey hairs upregulate proteins related to energy metabolism, mitochondria, and antioxidant defenses. Combining HPP profiling and proteomics on single hairs, we also report hair greying and reversal that can occur in parallel with psychological stressors. To generalize these observations, we develop a computational simulation, which suggests a threshold-based mechanism for the temporary reversibility of greying. Conclusions:. Overall, this new method to quantitatively map recent life history in HPPs provides an opportunity to longitudinally examine the influence of recent life exposures on human biology. Funding:.

We demonstrate the capabilities and drawbacks of G-LED in simulations of several benchmark systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, two-dimensional high Reynolds number flow over a backward-facing step, and simulations of three-dimensional turbulent channel flow.

	abstract = {Major depression is an established risk factor for subsequent dementia, and depression in late life may also represent a prodromal state of dementia. Considering current challenges in the clinical development of disease modifying therapies for dementia, the focus of research is shifting towards prevention and modification of risk factors to alter the neurodegenerative disease trajectory. Understanding mechanistic commonalities underlying affective symptoms and cognitive decline may reveal biomarkers to aid early identification of those at risk of progressing to dementia during the preclinical phase of disease, thus allowing for timely intervention. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a phenomenon that describes the birth of new neurons in the dentate gyrus throughout life and it is associated with spatial learning, memory and mood regulation. Microglia are innate immune system macrophages in the central nervous system that carefully regulate AHN via multiple mechanisms. Disruption in AHN is associated with both dementia and major depression and microgliosis is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity, including neurogenesis, and may also be immunomodulatory. In this context, psilocybin, a serotonergic agonist with rapid-acting antidepressant properties has the potential to ameliorate intersecting pathophysiological processes relevant for both major depression and neurodegenerative diseases. In this narrative review, we focus on the evidence base for the effects of psilocybin on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial form and function; which may suggest that psilocybin has the potential to modulate multiple mechanisms of action, and may have implications in altering the progression from major depression to dementia in those at risk.},

Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.},

	abstract = {When a pulse of light traverses a material, it incurs a time delay referred to as the group delay. Should the group delay experienced by photons be attributed to the time they spend as atomic excitations? However reasonable this connection may seem, it appears problematic when the frequency of the light is close to the atomic resonance, as the group delay becomes negative in this regime. To address this question, we use the cross-Kerr effect to probe the degree of atomic excitation caused by a resonant transmitted photon, by measuring the phase shift on a separate beam that is weak and off-resonant. Our results, over a range of pulse durations and optical depths, are consistent with the recent theoretical prediction that the mean atomic excitation time caused by a transmitted photon (as measured via the time integral of the observed phase shift) equals the group delay experienced by the light. Specifically, we measure mean atomic excitation times ranging from \$(-0.82{\textbackslash}pm 0.31) {\textbackslash}tau\_0\$ for the most narrowband pulse to \$(0.54{\textbackslash}pm 0.28) {\textbackslash}tau\_0\$ for the most broadband pulse, where \${\textbackslash}tau\_0\$ is the non-post-selected excitation time, given by the scattering (absorption) probability multiplied by the atomic lifetime \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm sp\}\$. These results suggest that negative values taken by times such as the group delay have more physical significance than has generally been appreciated.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the relationships between psilocybin dose, psychedelic experiences, and therapeutic outcome in treatment-resistant depression.
Methods
For treatment-resistant depression, 233 participants received a single dose of 25, 10, or 1 mg of COMP360 psilocybin (a proprietary, pharmaceutical-grade synthesized psilocybin formulation, developed by the sponsor, Compass Pathfinder Ltd.) with psychological support. The resulting psychedelic experience (Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire [5D-ASC] and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory [EBI]) were measured. These proximal variables and outcome 3 weeks post-administration (change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]) were explored using correlation analysis.
Results
The mean intensity of psychedelic effects was dose-related, but distributions of scores for different doses overlapped considerably. Depression response correlated with select aspects of the psychedelic experience overall and for individual doses. At the 25 mg dose, 5D-ASC dimensions Oceanic Boundlessness (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.508) and Visual Restructuralization (r = −0.516), and EBI (r = −0·637) were the variables with the strongest correlation to the Week 3 change from Baseline in MADRS score.
Limitations
The existence of correlation does not establish causation and exploratory findings require further replication, preferably in larger independent samples.
Conclusions
The intensity of psychedelic experience overlaps widely across doses and mitigates the risk of unblinding to dose. Correlations between psychedelic experience and outcome suggest specificity in psilocybin's mechanism of action. Quality and intensity of psychedelic experience may be a measure of pharmacodynamic effect and reveal an effective dose response phenomenon for single oral doses.},

We discover direct connections between L-conv and physics: (1) group invariant loss generalizes field theory (2) Euler-Lagrange equation measures the robustness, and (3) equivariance leads to conservation laws and Noether current.These connections open up new avenues for designing more general equivariant networks and applying them to important problems in physical sciences},

The book starts with a detailed presentation of the main classical theorems in the theory of foliations then proceeds to Molino's theory, Lie groupoids, constructing the holonomy groupoid of a foliation and finally Lie algebroids. Among other things, the authors discuss to what extent Lie's theory for Lie groups and Lie algebras holds in the more general context of groupoids and algebroids. Based on the authors' extensive teaching experience, this book contains numerous examples and exercises making it ideal for graduate students and their instructors.},

Traditional graph theoretical approaches have provided valuable insights into the topological properties of neural networks, yet they often overlook the temporal dynamics intrinsic to neuronal activity. In this work, we introduce Cerebrum, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates biologically plausible Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron models with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to simulate and infer synaptic connectivity in large-scale brain networks. Cerebrum leverages canonical network topologies: Erdös-Rényi, Small-World, and Scale-Free, to generate ground-truth connectivity matrices and employs advanced GNN architectures to accurately predict these connections from simulated neuronal activity patterns. By incorporating disease-specific parameter modifications, such as those mimicking Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, our framework enables the exploration of how pathological states influence network dynamics and connectivity inference. Additionally, we incorporate empirical synaptic data from C. elegans to enhance the biological fidelity of our simulations. Cerebrum is accompanied by an open-source computational toolkit, providing tools for neural dynamics simulation, connectivity inference, and interactive network perturbations. Our work represents a significant advancement in computational neuroscience, offering a biologically grounded machine learning framework for modeling and analyzing intricate brain network dynamics.},

Similarities in the activity and connectivity of these neuromodulatory systems have inspired competing models of how DA and 5HT interact to drive the formation of new associations9–14. However, these hypotheses have not been tested directly because it has not been possible to interrogate and manipulate multiple neuromodulatory systems in a single subject. Here, we establish a mouse model enabling simultaneous genetic access to the brain’s DA and 5HT neurons. Anterograde tracing revealed the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a putative hotspot for the integration of convergent DA and 5HT signals. Simultaneous recording of DA and 5HT axon activity, together with genetically encoded DA and 5HT sensor recordings, revealed that rewards increase DA signaling and decrease 5HT signaling in the NAc. Optogenetically dampening DA or 5HT reward responses individually produced modest behavioral deficits in an appetitive conditioning task, while blunting both signals together profoundly disrupted learning and reinforcement. Optogenetically reproducing DA and 5HT reward responses together was sufficient to drive acquisition of new associations and supported reinforcement more potently than either manipulation alone. Together, these results demonstrate that striatal DA and 5HT signals shape learning by exerting opponent control of reinforcement.},

Psilocybin, a promising candidate for treating depression, has been shown to acutely increase emotional empathy in healthy volunteers. However, no study has investigated this effect and its relevance for symptom improvement in a clinical population. This study examines the enduring effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy on empathy in depressed patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Fifty-one depressed patients were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of psilocybin (0215 mg/kg body weight) or a placebo embedded in a 4-week psychological support intervention. Empathy was measured using the Multifaceted Empathy Test at baseline and 2 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after substance administration. Changes in empathy were compared between treatment conditions. Patients who received psilocybin showed significant improvements in explicit emotional empathy driven by an increase in empathy towards positive stimuli compared to the placebo group for at least two weeks. This study highlights the potential of psychedelics to enhance social cognition in individuals living with depression and contributes to a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms of action of psychedelics. Further studies are necessary to investigate the interaction between social cognition and clinical efficacy.},

We recently reported an AD-associated CD83(+) microglia subtype associated with increased immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in the transverse colon (TC). METHODS We used immunohistochemistry (IHC), IgG4 repertoire profiling, and brain organoid experiments to explore this association. RESULTS CD83(+) microglia in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) are associated with elevated IgG4 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the TC, anti-HCMV IgG4 in cerebrospinal fluid, and both HCMV and IgG4 in the SFG and vagal nerve. This association was replicated in an independent AD cohort. HCMV-infected cerebral organoids showed accelerated AD pathophysiological features (Aβ42 and pTau-212) and neuronal death. DISCUSSION Findings indicate complex, cross-tissue interactions between HCMV and the adaptive immune response associated with CD83(+) microglia in persons with AD. This may indicate an opportunity for antiviral therapy in persons with AD and biomarker evidence of HCMV, IgG4, or CD83(+) microglia.

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that incipient protein pathology in the medial temporal lobe instigates the loss of episodic memory in Alzheimer’s disease, one of the earliest cognitive deficits in this type of dementia. Within this region, the hippocampus is seen as the most vital for episodic memory. Consequently, research into the causes of memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease continues to centre on hippocampal dysfunction and how disease-modifying therapies in this region can potentially alleviate memory symptomology. The present review questions this entrenched notion by bringing together findings from post-mortem studies, non-invasive imaging (including studies of presymptomatic, at-risk cases) and genetically modified animal models. The combined evidence indicates that the loss of episodic memory in early Alzheimer’s disease reflects much wider neurodegeneration in an extended mnemonic system (Papez circuit), which critically involves the limbic thalamus. Within this system, the anterior thalamic nuclei are prominent, both for their vital contributions to episodic memory and for how these same nuclei appear vulnerable in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. As thalamic abnormalities occur in some of the earliest stages of the disease, the idea that such changes are merely secondary to medial temporal lobe dysfunctions is challenged. This alternate view is further strengthened by the interdependent relationship between the anterior thalamic nuclei and retrosplenial cortex, given how dysfunctions in the latter cortical area provide some of the earliest in vivo imaging evidence of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Appreciating the importance of the anterior thalamic nuclei for memory and attention provides a more balanced understanding of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, this refocus on the limbic thalamus, as well as the rest of Papez circuit, would have significant implications for the diagnostics, modelling, and experimental treatment of cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease.},

In this work, we investigated functional brain networks derived from resting-state fMRI data obtained under different doses of isoflurane in mice using stationary and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. Stationary network analysis using FSL Nets revealed a modular structure of functional networks, which could be segregated into a lateral cortical, an associative cortical network, elements of the prefrontal network, a subcortical network, and a thalamic network. Increasing isoflurane dose led to a loss of functional connectivity between the bilateral cortical regions. In addition, dFC analysis revealed a dominance of dynamic functional states (dFS) exhibiting modular structure in mice anesthetized with a low dose of isoflurane, while at high isoflurane levels dFS showing widespread unstructured correlation displayed highest weights. This indicates that spatial segregation across brain functional networks is lost with increasing dose of the anesthetic drug used. To what extent this indicates a state of deep anesthesia remains to be shown. Combining the results of stationary and dynamic FC analysis indicates that increasing isoflurane levels leads to loss of modular network organization, which includes loss of the strong bilateral interactions between homotopic brain areas.},

It can exhibit a marked and functionally relevant spatial variability, and can be perturbed by several pathological conditions. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) is a technique devised to enquire this pattern of brain organization, based on resting state functional connectivity. Since functional connectivity can be revealed also in a meta-analytical fashion using co-activations, here we propose to calculate the meta-analytic homotopic connectivity (MHC) as the meta-analytic counterpart of the VMHC. The comparison between the two techniques reveals their general similarity, but also highlights regional differences associated with how HC varies from task to rest. Two main differences were found from rest to task: (i) regions known to be characterized by global hubness are more similar than regions displaying local hubness; and (ii) medial areas are characterized by a higher degree of homotopic connectivity, while lateral areas appear to decrease their degree of homotopic connectivity during task performance. These findings show that MHC can be an insightful tool to study how the hemispheres functionally interact during task and rest conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Abnormal functional connectivity (FC) in the brain has been observed in schizophrenia patients. However, studies on FC between homotopic brain regions are limited, and the results of these studies are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to compare homotopic connectivity between first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients and healthy subjects and assess its correlation with clinical symptoms.
Methods
Thirty-one FES patients and thirty-three healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) method of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to analyse the changes in homotopic connectivity between the two groups. The 5-factor PANSS model was used to quantitatively evaluate the severity of symptoms in FES patients. Partial correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between homotopic connectivity changes and clinical symptoms.
Results
Compared to those in the HC group, VMHC values were decreased in the paracentral lobule (PL), thalamus, and superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the FES group (P {\textless} 0.05, FDR correction). No significant differences in white matter volume (WMV) within the subregion of the corpus callosum or in brain regions associated with reduced VMHC were observed between the two groups. Partial correlation analyses revealed that VMHC in the bilateral STG of FES patients was positively correlated with negative symptoms (rleft = 0.46, p {\textless} 0.05; rright = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.05), and VMHC in the right thalamus was negatively correlated with disorganized/concrete symptoms (rright = 0.45, p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusion
Our study revealed that homotopic connectivity is altered in the resting-state brain of FES patients and correlates with the severity of negative symptoms; this change may be independent of structural changes in white matter. These findings may contribute to the development of the abnormal connectivity hypothesis in schizophrenia patients.},

Data of 25 late stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) patients, 30 early stages of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) patients and 30 well-matched healthy controls (HC) were analyzed from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We focused on the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the thalamus and those in all other brain regions. Compared to healthy controls, we found functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and a set of brain areas was decreased in LMCI and/or EMCI including right fusiform gyrus (FG), left and right superior temporal gyrus, left medial frontal gyrus extending into supplementary motor area, right insula, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG) extending into middle occipital gyrus (MOG). We also observed increased functional connectivity between the left/right thalamus and several regions in LMCI and/or EMCI including left FG, right MOG, left and right precuneus, right MTG and left inferior temporal gyrus. In the direct comparison between the LMCI and EMCI groups, we obtained several brain regions showed thalamus-seeded functional connectivity differences such as the precentral gyrus, hippocampus, FG and MTG. Briefly, these brain regions mentioned above were mainly located in the thalamo-related networks including thalamo-hippocampus, thalamo-temporal, thalamo-visual, and thalamo-default mode network. The decreased functional connectivity of the thalamus might suggest reduced functional integrity of thalamo-related networks and increased functional connectivity indicated that aMCI patients could use additional brain resources to compensate for the loss of cognitive function. Our study provided a new sight to understand the two important states of aMCI and revealed resting-state fMRI is an appropriate method for exploring pathophysiological changes in aMCI.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

Despite developmental absence (i.e., agenesis) of the corpus callosum (AgCC), functional connectivity is preserved, including interhemispheric connectivity. Subcortical structures have been hypothesised to provide alternative pathways to enable this preservation. To test this hypothesis, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) recordings in children with AgCC and typically developing children, and a time-resolved approach to retrieve temporal characteristics of whole-brain functional networks. We observed an increased engagement of the cerebellum and amygdala/hippocampus networks in children with AgCC compared to typically developing children. There was little evidence that laterality of activation networks was affected in AgCC. Our findings support the hypothesis that subcortical structures play an essential role in the functional reconfiguration of the brain in the absence of a corpus callosum.},

Many studies have reported the disrupted brain alteration during the imminent conversion from pMCI to AD. However, the subtle difference of structural and functional of inter-hemispheric between pMCI and stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) remains unknown. In the present study, we scanned the multimodal magnetic resonance imaging of 38 sMCI, 26 pMCI, and 50 healthy controls (HC) and assessed the cognitive function. The voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and volume of corpus callosum were calculated. A structural equation modeling (SEM) was established to determine the relationships between the corpus callosum, the inter-hemispheric connectivity, and cognitive assessment. Compared to sMCI, pMCI exhibited decreased VMHC in insular and thalamus, and reduced volume of corpus callosum. SEM results showed that decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity was directly associated with cognitive impairment and corpus callosum atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy indirectly caused cognitive impairment by mediating inter-hemispheric connectivity in pMCI. In conclusion, the destruction of homotopic connectivity is related to cognitive impairment, and the corpus callosum atrophy partially mediates the association between the homotopic connectivity and cognitive impairment in pMCI.},

The white matter (WM) BOLD signal has recently been shown to provide an important role in understanding the intrinsic cerebral activity. Although the altered homotopic functional connectivity within gray matter (GM-HFC) has been examined in AD, the abnormal HFC to WM remains unknown. The present study sought to identify changes in the WM-HFC and anatomic characteristics by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Resting-state and DTI magnetic resonance images were collected from the OASIS-3 dataset and consisted of 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 90 very MCI (VMCI), and 100 normal cognitive (NC) subjects. Voxel-mirrored HFC was adopted to examine whether WM-HFC was disrupted in VMCI and MCI participants. Moreover, the DTI technique was used to investigate whether specific alterations of WM-HFC were associated with anatomic characteristics. Support vector machine analyses were used to identify the MCI and VMCI participants using the abnormal WM-HFC as the features. Compared with NC, MCI, and VMCI participants showed significantly decreased GM-HFC in the middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus and decreased WM-HFC in the bilateral middle occipital and parietal lobe-WM. In addition, specific WM-functional network alteration for the bilateral sub-lobar-WM was found in MCI subjects. MCI subjects showed abnormal anatomic characteristics for bilateral sub-lobar and parietal lobe-WM. Results of GM-HFC mainly showed common neuroimaging features for VMCI and MCI subjects, whereas analysis of WM-HFC showed specific clinical neuromarkers and effectively compensated for the lack of GM-HFC to distinguish NC, VMCI, and MCI subjects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug worldwide. With debate surrounding the legalization and control of use, investigating its health risks has become a pressing area of research. One established association is that between cannabis use and schizophrenia, a debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting {\textasciitilde}1\% of the population over their lifetime. Although considerable evidence implicates cannabis use as a component cause of schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether this is entirely due to cannabis directly raising risk of psychosis, or whether the same genes that increases psychosis risk may also increase risk of cannabis use. In a sample of 2082 healthy individuals, we show an association between an individual’s burden of schizophrenia risk alleles and use of cannabis. This was significant both for comparing those who have ever versus never used cannabis (P=2.6 × 10−4), and for quantity of use within users (P=3.0 × 10−3). Although directly predicting only a small amount of the variance in cannabis use, these findings suggest that part of the association between schizophrenia and cannabis is due to a shared genetic aetiology. This form of gene–environment correlation is an important consideration when calculating the impact of environmental risk factors, including cannabis use.},

	abstract = {There are good reasons to be concerned about the possibility that cannabis use may be a cause of psychotic disorders. Psychoses are serious and disabling disorders (Bromet et al., 1995). Cannabis is widely used during late adolescence in many developed societies (Hall et al., 1999), and high doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the psychoactive substance in cannabis – have been reported to produce psychotic symptoms such as visual and auditory hallucinations, delusional ideas and thought disorder in normal volunteers (Hall et al., 2001; and see Chapter 5).There are a number of hypotheses about the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis that need to be distinguished (Thornicroft, 1990). The strongest hypothesis in causal terms is that heavy cannabis use causes a specific ‘cannabis psychosis’. It assumes that these psychoses would not occur in the absence of cannabis use, and that the causal role of cannabis can be inferred from the symptoms and their relationship to cannabis use; that is, they are preceded by heavy cannabis use and remit after abstinence. It also assumes that cannabis psychoses are qualitatively different from other psychotic disorders. This hypothesis is the subject of this chapter. The potential role of cannabis as a causal agent for schizophrenia per se is the subject of Chapter 7.Making causal inferencesIn order to infer that cannabis use is a cause of a specific psychotic disorder, we need evidence: that there is an association between cannabis use and psychosis; that chance is an unlikely explanation of the association; that cannabis use preceded the psychosis; and that plausible alternative explanations of the association can be excluded (Hall, 1987).},

	abstract = {Cannabis, a widely used psychoactive substance, can trigger acute cannabis-associated psychotic symptoms (CAPS) in people who use cannabis (PWUC). To assess rates and correlates of CAPS requiring emergency medical treatment, we analyzed data from an international sample of PWUC (n = 233,475). We found that 0.47\% (95\%CI 0.42; 0.52) PWUC reported lifetime occurrence of CAPS, defined as the occurrence of hallucinations and/or paranoia requiring emergency medical treatment following the use of cannabis. A range of factors correlated with risk of CAPS in the last year: higher rates were observed in young individuals [risk ratio (RR) 2.66, compared to older PWUC] and those residing in Denmark (RR 3.01, compared to PWUC from other countries). Furthermore, risk was elevated in those using predominantly high-potency resin (RR 2.11, compared to PWUC using herbal cannabis), those mixing cannabis with tobacco (RR 2.15, compared to PWUC not mixing with tobacco) and those with a diagnosis of psychosis (RR 14.01), bipolar (RR 4.30), anxiety (RR 2.92) and depression (RR 2.68), compared to individuals without a mental health diagnosis. Taken together, acute self-limiting psychotic symptoms in the context of cannabis use may occur in about 1 in 200 PWUC’s lifetime. Some individuals could be particularly sensitive to the adverse psychological effects of cannabis, such as young individuals or those with pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities. In light of the movements towards legalization of recreational cannabis, more research should focus on the potential harms related to cannabis use, to educate PWUC and the public about risks related to its use.},

In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was not associated with a change in the number of psychotic symptoms unless it interacted with a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, in which case the number of symptoms increased, or with a personal (but not family) history of psychotic disorders, in which case the number of symptoms decreased.

However, there are limited data on the transition risk for substance use without psychosis.To quantify the risk of transition to schizophrenia spectrum disorder following an incident emergency department (ED) visit for (1) substance-induced psychosis and (2) substance use without psychosis and to explore factors associated with transition.A population-based retrospective cohort study (January 2008 to March 2022) of all individuals, aged 14 to 65 years, in Ontario, Canada, with no history of a psychotic disorder. Individuals with incident ED visits for substance use with and without psychosis were compared with members of the general population.Transition to schizophrenia spectrum disorder using a chart-validated algorithm. Associations between ED visits for substance use and subsequent transition were estimated using cause-specific hazard models.The study included 9 844 497 individuals, aged 14 to 65 years (mean [SD] age, 40.2 [14.7] years; 50.2\% female) without a history of psychosis. There were 407 737 individuals with an incident ED visit for substance use, of which 13 784 (3.4\%) ED visits were for substance-induced psychosis. Individuals with substance-induced psychosis were at a 163-fold (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 163.2; 95\% CI, 156.1-170.5) increased risk of transitioning, relative to the general population (3-year risk, 18.5\% vs 0.1\%). Individuals with an ED visit for substance use without psychosis had a lower relative risk of transitioning (aHR, 9.8; 95\% CI, 9.5-10.2; 3-year risk, 1.4\%), but incurred more than 3 times the absolute number of transitions (9969 vs 3029). Cannabis use had the highest transition risk among visits with psychosis (aHR, 241.6; 95\% CI, 225.5-258.9) and the third-highest risk among visits without psychosis (aHR, 14.3; 95\% CI, 13.5-15.2). Younger age and male sex were associated with a higher risk of transition, and the risk of male sex was greater in younger compared with older individuals, particularly for cannabis use.The findings of this cohort study suggest that ED visits for substance use were associated with an increased risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Although substance-induced psychoses had a greater relative transition risk, substance use without psychosis was far more prevalent and resulted in a greater absolute number of transitions. Several factors were associated with higher transition risk, with implications for counseling and early intervention.},

SoI provide a powerful structured framework of AIIM for understanding and evaluating insight-based meditative development through changes in perception, experiences of self, cognition, and emotional processing. Yet, the neurophenomenology of SoI remains unstudied due to methodological difficulties, rarity of suitable advanced meditation practitioners, and dominant research emphasis on attention-based meditative practices. We investigated the neurophenomenology of SoI in an intensively sampled adept meditator case study (4 hr 7T fMRI collected in 26 runs with concurrent phenomenology) who performed SoI and rated specific aspects of experience immediately thereafter. Linear mixed models and correlations were used to examine relations among the cortex, subcortex, brainstem, and cerebellum, and SoI phenomenology. We identified distinctive whole-brain activity patterns associated with specific SoI, and that were different from two non-meditative control states. SoI consistently deactivated regions implicated in self-related processing, including the medial prefrontal cortex and temporal poles, while activating regions associated with awareness and perception, including the parietal and visual cortices, caudate, several brainstem nuclei, and cerebellum. Patterns of brain activity related to affective processing and SoI phenomenology were also identified. Our study presents the first neurophenomenological evidence that SoI shifts and deconstructs self-related perception and conceptualization, and increases general awareness and perceptual sensitivity and acuity. Our study provides SoI as a foundation for investigative, and advanced meditation in particular.},

	abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is emerging as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy in the battle against Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease patients primarily show alterations of the default mode network for which the precuneus is a key node. Here, we hypothesized that targeting the precuneus with TMS represents a promising strategy to slow down cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. We performed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, phase 2, 24-week trial to determine the safety and efficacy of precuneus stimulation in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Fifty Alzheimer's disease patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either receive precuneus or sham rTMS (mean age 73.7 years; 52\% female). The trial included a 24-week treatment, with a 2-week intensive course in which rTMS (or sham) was applied daily five times per week, followed by a 22-week maintenance phase in which stimulation was applied once weekly. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes was selected as the primary outcome measure, in which post-treatment scores were compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes included score changes in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale. Moreover, single-pulse TMS in combination with EEG was used to assess neurophysiological changes in precuneus cortical excitability and oscillatory activity. Our findings show that patients that received precuneus repetitive magnetic stimulation presented a stable performance of the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes score, whereas patients treated with sham showed a worsening of their score. Compared with the sham stimulation, patients in the precuneus stimulation group also showed also significantly better performances for the secondary outcome measures, including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale. Neurophysiological results showed that precuneus cortical excitability remained unchanged after 24 weeks in the precuneus stimulation group, whereas it was significantly reduced in the sham group. Finally, we found an enhancement of local gamma oscillations in the group treated with precuneus stimulation but not in patients treated with sham. We conclude that 24 weeks of precuneus rTMS may slow down cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer's disease. Repetitive TMS targeting the default mode network could represent a novel therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease patients.},

	abstract = {A pseudogroup is a complete infinitely distributive inverse monoid. Such inverse monoids bear the same relationship to classical pseudogroups of transformations as frames do to topological spaces. The goal of this paper is to develop the theory of pseudogroups motivated by applications to group theory, C∗-algebras and aperiodic tilings. Our starting point is an adjunction between a category of pseudogroups and a category of étale groupoids from which we are able to set up a duality between spatial pseudogroups and sober étale groupoids. As a corollary to this duality, we deduce a non-commutative version of Stone duality involving what we call boolean inverse semigroups and boolean étale groupoids, as well as a generalization of this duality to distributive inverse semigroups. Non-commutative Stone duality has important applications in the theory of C∗-algebras: it is the basis for the construction of Cuntz and Cuntz–Krieger algebras and in the case of the Cuntz algebras it can also be used to construct the Thompson groups. We then define coverages on inverse semigroups and the resulting presentations of pseudogroups. As applications, we show that Paterson’s universal groupoid is an example of a booleanization, and reconcile Exel’s recent work on the theory of tight maps with the work of the second author.},

By quantifying topographic principles of macroscale organization, cortical gradients lend an analytical framework to study structural and functional brain organization across species, throughout development and aging, and its perturbations in disease. Here, we present BrainSpace, a Python/Matlab toolbox for (i) the identification of gradients, (ii) their alignment, and (iii) their visualization.

Nonetheless, it has long been appreciated that developing a sound and general understanding of the thermodynamics of such non-equilibrium scenarios could ultimately enable us to control and imitate the marvellous successes that living things achieve in driven self-assembly. Here, I suggest that such a theoretical understanding may at last be emerging, and trace its development from historic first steps to more recent discoveries.

We observe surprising similarities between the behaviors of computations and systems near phase transitions, finding analogs of computational complexity classes and the halting problem within the phenomenology of phase transitions. We conclude that there is a fundamental connection between computation and phase transitions, especially second-order or “critical” transitions, and discuss some of the implications for our understanding of nature if such a connection is borne out.},

Disruptions to interconnectivity in certain networks have been linked to symptoms of depression and impairments in cognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a low-burden tool by which differences in functional connectivity (FC) can be assessed. This systematic review aims to provide a synthesis of evidence relating to EEG FC in depression. A comprehensive electronic literature search for terms relating to depression, EEG, and FC was conducted on studies published before the end of November 2021, according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies comparing EEG measures of FC of individuals with depression to that of healthy control groups were included. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers, and the quality of EEG FC methods was assessed. Fifty-two studies assessing EEG FC in depression were identified: 36 assessed resting-state FC, and 16 assessed task-related or other (i.e., sleep) FC. Somewhat consistent findings in resting-state studies suggest for no differences between depression and control groups in EEG FC in the delta and gamma frequencies. However, while most resting-state studies noted a difference in alpha, theta, and beta, no clear conclusions could be drawn about the direction of the difference, due to considerable inconsistencies between study design and methodology. This was also true for task-related and other EEG FC. More robust research is needed to understand the true differences in EEG FC in depression. Given that the FC between brain regions drives behaviour, cognition, and emotion, characterising how FC differs in depression is essential for understanding the aetiology of depression.},

The existing techniques of detecting depression need a lot of interaction with humans, and the findings are highly reliant on the knowledge and skill of the doctor doing them. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a potential tool that reveals interesting information that can be used in diagnosis and evaluation of human beings’ brain abnormalities with excellent time resolution; however, detecting depression is a challenge for engineers and scientists to support personalized health care. However, EEG may provide an idea of cognitive decline toward depression classification. To create a neurophysiological diagnostic index for therapeutic use that is sensitive to the severity of depression, it may be possible to combine the EEG with other biological, cognitive markers, and imaging methods. The goal of the current study is to emphasize baseline EEG activity in depressed individuals, beginning with EEG signal collection and continuing through EEG data preprocessing steps for signal augmentation, linear and nonlinear properties. The subsequent focus will be on EEG signal extraction to account for the large swings of EEG signals, followed by classification approaches to differentiate the severity of depression. Therefore, the present review has examined the role of EEG signal processing and analysis in helping medical doctors and clinicians to determine suitable planning and optimal, more effective treatment programs.},

Autoencoders (AEs) have played a key role in the area of representation learning, with numerous regularization techniques and training principles developed not only to enhance their ability to learn compact and robust representations, but also to reveal how different architectures influence the structure and smoothness of the lower-dimensional non-linear manifold. We strive to characterize the structure of the latent spaces learned by different autoencoders including convolutional autoencoders (CAEs), denoising autoencoders (DAEs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs) and how they change with the perturbations in the input. By characterizing the matrix manifolds corresponding to the latent spaces, we provide an explanation for the well-known observation that the latent spaces of CAE and DAE form non-smooth manifolds, while that of VAE forms a smooth manifold. We also map the points of the matrix manifold to a Hilbert space using distance preserving transforms and provide an alternate view in terms of the subspaces generated in the Hilbert space as a function of the distortion in the input. The results show that the latent manifolds of CAE and DAE are stratified with each stratum being a smooth product manifold, while the manifold of VAE is a smooth product manifold of two symmetric positive definite matrices and a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix.},

When applied to Gaussian examples, SymmetryGAN shows excellent empirical performance, in agreement with expectations from the analytic loss landscape. SymmetryGAN is then applied to simulated dijet events from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to demonstrate the potential utility of this method in high energy collider physics applications.

	abstract = {Humans perceive and interact with hundreds of objects every day. In doing so, they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries in the object’s shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to understanding and modelling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper bound on their surprisal, i.e. their free energy. The free energy decomposes into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favour the least complex model that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space. Second, we do a principal component analysis to demonstrate how the model encodes the principal axis of symmetry of the object in the latent space. Finally, we also demonstrate how more symmetrical representations can be exploited for better generalization in the context of manipulation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite parallel research indicating amyloid-β accumulation, alterations in cortical neurophysiological signaling, and multi-system neurotransmitter disruptions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the relationships between these phenomena remains unclear.
METHODS: Using magnetoencephalography, positron emission tomography, and an atlas of 19 neurotransmitters, we studied the alignment between neurophysiological alterations, amyloid-β deposition, and the neurochemical gradients of the cortex.
RESULTS: In patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD, changes in cortical rhythms were topographically aligned with cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic systems. These alignments correlated with the severity of clinical impairments. Additionally, cortical amyloid-β plaques were preferentially deposited along neurochemical boundaries, influencing how neurophysiological alterations align with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Most of the amyloid-β-neurochemical and alpha-band neuro-physio-chemical alignments replicated in an independent dataset of individuals with asymptomatic amyloid-β accumulation.
DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that AD pathology aligns topographically with the cortical distribution of chemical neuromodulator systems and scales with clinical severity, with implications for potential pharmacotherapeutic pathways.
HIGHLIGHTS: Changes in cortical rhythms in Alzheimer's are organized along neurochemical boundaries. The strength of these alignments is related to clinical symptom severity. Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) is aligned with similar neurotransmitter systems. Aβ deposition mediates the alignment of beta rhythms with cholinergic systems. Most alignments replicate in participants with pre-clinical Alzheimer's pathology.},

Herein, we model the spreading of both amyloid-β and tau across a human connectome and investigate how the neuronal dynamics are affected by disease progression. By including the effects of both amyloid-β and tau pathology, we find that our model explains AD-related frequency slowing, early-stage hyperactivation and late-stage hypoactivation. By testing different hypotheses, we show that hyperactivation and frequency slowing are not due to the topological interactions between different regions but are mostly the result of local neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-β and tau protein.},

We found that while the acute intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LSD (5, 15 and 30 and 60 μg/kg) did not produce any anxiolytic or antidepressant effects in non-stressed mice, the dose of 30 µg/kg (daily for 7 days) prevented the stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the stress-induced decrease of cortical spine densitiy. Interestingly, while LSD acutely decreased the firing activity of 5-HT neurons, repeated LSD increased their basal firing rate and restored the low 5-HT firing induced by stress. This effect was accompanied by a decreased inhibitory response of 5-HT neurons to microiontophoretic applications of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin). In conclusion, repeated LSD prevents the exacerbation of anxiety-like behavior following chronic stress exposure, but has no behavioral effects in non-stressed mice. These effects are paralleled by increased cortical spinogenesis and an enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission which might be due to 5-HT1A receptors desensitization. Increased cortical spine density and enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission may thus represent a candidate mechanism which mediate the therapeutic effects of serotonergic psychedelics on stress-induced anxiety.},

Experiencing this type of seizure, along with other seizure types, such as focal motor seizures and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, can result in a disabling situation. Non-invasive brain stimulation methods like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) show promise in reducing seizure frequency (SF) when medications are ineffective. However, research on tDCS for EPC and related seizures is limited. We evaluated personalized multichannel tDCS in drug-resistant EPC of diverse etiologies for long-term clinical efficacy We report three EPC patients undergoing a long-term protocol of multichannel tDCS. The patients received several cycles (11, 9, and 3) of five consecutive days of stimulation at 2 mA for 2 × 20 min, targeting the epileptogenic zone (EZ), including the central motor cortex with cathodal electrodes. The primary measurement was SF changes. In three cases, EPC was due to Rasmussen's Encephalitis (case 1), focal cortical dysplasia (case 2), or remained unknown (case 3). tDCS cycles were administered over 6 to 22 months. The outcomes comprised a reduction of at least 75\% in seizure frequency for two patients, and in one case, a complete cessation of severe motor seizures. However, tDCS had no substantial impact on the continuous myoclonus characterizing EPC. No serious side effects were reported. Long-term application of tDCS cycles is well tolerated and can lead to a considerable reduction in disabling seizures in patients with various forms of epilepsy with EPC.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that some brain areas act as hubs interconnecting distinct, functionally specialized systems. These nexuses are intriguing because of their potential role in integration and also because they may augment metabolic cascades relevant to brain disease. To identify regions of high connectivity in the human cerebral cortex, we applied a computationally efficient approach to map the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity across the brain. Analysis of two separate functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets (each n = 24) demonstrated hubs throughout heteromodal areas of association cortex. Prominent hubs were located within posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, lateral parietal, and medial/lateral prefrontal cortices. Network analysis revealed that many, but not all, hubs were located within regions previously implicated as components of the default network. A third dataset (n = 12) demonstrated that the locations of hubs were present across passive and active task states, suggesting that they reflect a stable property of cortical network architecture. To obtain an accurate reference map, data were combined across 127 participants to yield a consensus estimate of cortical hubs. Using this consensus estimate, we explored whether the topography of hubs could explain the pattern of vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD) because some models suggest that regions of high activity and metabolism accelerate pathology. Positron emission tomography amyloid imaging in AD (n = 10) compared with older controls (n = 29) showed high amyloid-beta deposition in the locations of cortical hubs consistent with the possibility that hubs, while acting as critical way stations for information processing, may also augment the underlying pathological cascade in AD.},

Many patients harboring genetic mutations that lead to increased Aβ production suffer from seizures and epilepsy before the development of plaques.

Here we report analogous changes in macroscopic oscillatory neurophysiology in the human brain. We used positron emission tomography and task-free magnetoencephalography to test the effects of Aβ and tau deposition on cortical neurophysiology in 104 cognitively unimpaired older adults with a family history of sporadic AD. In these asymptomatic individuals, we found that Aβ depositions colocalize with accelerated neurophysiological activity. In those also presenting medial–temporal tau pathology, linear mixed effects of Aβ and tau depositions indicate a shift toward slower neurophysiological activity, which was also linked to cognitive decline. We conclude that early Aβ and tau depositions relate synergistically to human cortical neurophysiology and subsequent cognitive decline. Our findings provide insight into the multifaceted neurophysiological mechanisms engaged in the preclinical phases of AD.},

METHODS: A total of 526 participants in early clinical stages of AD and controls from a longitudinal cohort were neurobiologically classified for amyloid and tau pathology applying the AT(N) system. Aβ and tau oligomers in the quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured using surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) technology.
RESULTS: Across groups, highest Aβ oligomer levels were found in A+ with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Aβ oligomers were significantly higher in A+T- compared to A-T- and A+T+. APOE ε4 allele carriers showed significantly higher Aβ oligomer levels. No differences in tau oligomers were detected.
DISCUSSION: The accumulation of Aβ oligomers in the CSF peaks early within the AD continuum, preceding tau pathology. Disease-modifying treatments targeting Aβ oligomers might have the highest therapeutic effect in these disease stages.
HIGHLIGHTS: Using surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (sFIDA) technology, we quantified Aβ oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of the DZNE-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (DELCODE) cohortAβ oligomers were significantly elevated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)Amyloid-positive subjects in the subjective cognitive decline (SCD) group increased compared to the amyloid-negative control groupInterestingly, levels of Aβ oligomers decrease at advanced stages of the disease (A+T+), which might be explained by altered clearing mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD {\textless} HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.},

	abstract = {The inquiry into the origin of brain complexity remains a pivotal question in neuroscience. While synaptic stimuli are acknowledged as significant, their efficacy often falls short in elucidating the extensive interconnections of the brain and nuanced levels of cognitive integration. Recent advances in neuroscience have brought the mechanisms underlying the generation of highly intricate dynamics, emergent patterns, and sophisticated oscillatory signals into question. Within this context, our study, in alignment with current research, postulates the hypothesis that ephaptic communication, in addition to synaptic mediation’s, may emerge as a prime candidate for unraveling optimal brain complexity. Ephaptic communication, hitherto little studied, refers to direct interactions of the electric field between adjacent neurons, without the mediation of traditional synapses (electrical or chemical). We propose that these electric field couplings may provide an additional layer of connectivity that facilitates the formation of complex patterns and emergent dynamics in the brain. In this investigation, we conducted a comparative analysis between two types of networks utilizing the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Ephaptic model (QIF-E): (I) a small-world synaptic network (ephaptic-off) and (II) a mixed composite network comprising a small-world synaptic network with the addition of an ephaptic network (ephaptic-on). Utilizing the Multiscale Entropy methodology, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the responses generated by both network configurations, with complexity assessed by integrating across all temporal scales. Our findings demonstrate that ephaptic coupling enhances complexity under specific topological conditions, considering variables such as time, spatial scales, and synaptic intensity. These results offer fresh insights into the dynamics of communication within the nervous system and underscore the fundamental role of ephapticity in regulating complex brain functions.},

The role of perception is to build such a model for the current environment; knowledge provides many of the building blocks; in episodic memory, a previous model is reinstated; in cognitive control, the model dictates a choice of action. A model, I suggest, is a compositional, whole brain state, combining information from multiple specialised brain systems into a structured description of entities in the model and their roles and relationships. The default mode network may play an organizational role as parts of a model are combined into a broader whole. The model combines an active attentional foreground with a more extensive, latent background. Foreground is based on active neural firing, orchestrated by the brain’s multiple demand network. Background may also include low-intensity neural activity, but with a substantial contribution from both faster and slower aspects of synaptic change. Interplay between foreground and background underlies core aspects of cognition, including cognitive control, problem solving, abstraction, and learning. Together, these proposals suggest how integrated, whole-brain functions build mental models, providing a unifying framework for the diverse concerns of cognitive neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Animals are born with extensive innate behavioral capabilities, which arise from neural circuits encoded in the genome. However, the information capacity of the genome is orders of magnitude smaller than that needed to specify the connectivity of an arbitrary brain circuit, indicating that the rules encoding circuit formation must fit through a “genomic bottleneck” as they pass from one generation to the next. Here, we formulate the problem of innate behavioral capacity in the context of artificial neural networks in terms of lossy compression of the weight matrix. We find that several standard network architectures can be compressed by several orders of magnitude, yielding pretraining performance that can approach that of the fully trained network. Interestingly, for complex but not for simple test problems, the genomic bottleneck algorithm also captures essential features of the circuit, leading to enhanced transfer learning to novel tasks and datasets. Our results suggest that compressing a neural circuit through the genomic bottleneck serves as a regularizer, enabling evolution to select simple circuits that can be readily adapted to important real-world tasks. The genomic bottleneck also suggests how innate priors can complement conventional approaches to learning in designing algorithms for AI.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE:
A realistic seizure diary simulator is currently unavailable for many research needs, including clinical trial analysis, and evaluation of seizure detection and seizure forecasting tools. In recent years, important statistical features of seizure diaries have been characterized. These include: (1) heterogeneity of individual seizure frequencies, (2) the relation between average seizure rate and standard deviation, (3) multiple risk cycles, (4) seizure clusters, and (5) limitations on inter-seizure intervals. The present study unifies these features into a single model.

METHODS:
Our approach, Cyclic Heterogeneous Overdispersed Clustered Open-source L-relationship Adjustable Temporally limited E-diary Simulator (CHOCOLATES) is based on a hierarchical model centered on a Gamma Poisson generator with several modifiers. This model accounts for the aforementioned statistical properties. The model was validated by simulating 10,000 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of medication to compare with 23 historical RCTs. Metrics of 50\% responder rate (RR50) and median percent change (MPC) were evaluated. We also used CHOCOLATES as input to a seizure forecasting tool to test the flexibility of the model. We examined the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for test data with and without cycles and clusters.

RESULTS:
The model recapitulated typical findings in 23 historical RCTs without the necessity of introducing an additional “placebo effect”. The model produced the following RR50 values: placebo: 17±4\%; drug 38±5\%; and the following MPC values: placebo: 13±6\%; drug 40±4\%. These values are similar to historical data: for RR50: placebo, 21±10\%, drug: 43±13\%; and for MPC: placebo: 17±10\%, drug: 41±11\%. The seizure forecasts achieved AUC of 0.68 with cycles and clusters, whereas without them the AUC was 0.51.

SIGNIFICANCE:
CHOCOLATES represents the most realistic seizure occurrence simulator to date, based on observations from thousands of patients in different contexts. This tool is open-source and flexible, and can be used for many applications, including clinical trial simulation and testing of seizure forecasting tools.},

	abstract = {Background
There is currently no formal method for predicting the range expected in an individual's seizure counts. Having access to such a prediction would be of benefit for developing more efficient clinical trials, but also for improving clinical care in the outpatient setting.

Methods
Using three independently collected patient diary datasets, we explored the predictability of seizure frequency. Three independent seizure diary databases were explored: SeizureTracker (n = 3016), Human Epilepsy Project (n = 93), and NeuroVista (n = 15). First, the relationship between mean and standard deviation in seizure frequency was assessed. Using that relationship, a prediction for the range of possible seizure frequencies was compared with a traditional prediction scheme commonly used in clinical trials. A validation dataset was obtained from a separate data export of SeizureTracker to further verify the predictions.

Results
A consistent mathematical relationship was observed across datasets. The logarithm of the average seizure count was linearly related to the logarithm of the standard deviation with a high correlation (R
2 {\textgreater} 0.83). The three datasets showed high predictive accuracy for this log–log relationship of 94\%, compared with a predictive accuracy of 77\% for a traditional prediction scheme. The independent validation set showed that the log–log predicted 94\% of the correct ranges while the RR50 predicted 77\%.

Conclusion
Reliably predicting seizure frequency variability is straightforward based on knowledge of mean seizure frequency, across several datasets. With further study, this may help to increase the power of RCTs, and guide clinical practice.},

Previous findings from non-human primates suggest prefrontal beta frequency bursts as a correlate of transient inhibition during selective encoding. Human studies instead suggest a similar role for sensory alpha power fluctuations. To cast light on these discrepancies we employed a sequential working memory task with distractors for human participants. In particular, we examined their whole-brain electrophysiological activity in both alpha and beta bands with the same single-trial burst analysis earlier performed on non-human primates. Our results reconcile earlier findings by demonstrating that both alpha and beta bursts in humans correlate with the filtering and control of memory items, but with region and task-specific differences between the two rhythms. Occipital beta burst patterns were selectively modulated during the transition from sensory processing to memory retention whereas prefrontal and parietal beta bursts tracked sequence order and were proactively upregulated prior to upcoming target encoding. Occipital alpha bursts instead increased during the actual presentation of unwanted sensory stimuli. Source reconstruction additionally suggested the involvement of striatal and thalamic alpha and beta. Thus, specific whole-brain burst patterns correlate with different aspects of working memory control.},

We combine techniques from algorithmic information theory and stochastic thermodynamics to analyze the thermodynamic costs of TMs. We consider two different ways of realizing a given TM with a physical process. The first realization is designed to be thermodynamically reversible when fed with random input bits. The second realization is designed to generate less heat, up to an additive constant, than any realization that is computable (i.e., consistent with the physical Church-Turing thesis). We consider three different thermodynamic costs: The heat generated when the TM is run on each input (which we refer to as the “heat function”), the minimum heat generated when a TM is run with an input that results in some desired output (which we refer to as the “thermodynamic complexity” of the output, in analogy to the Kolmogorov complexity), and the expected heat on the input distribution that minimizes entropy production. For universal TMs, we show for both realizations that the thermodynamic complexity of any desired output is bounded by a constant (unlike the conventional Kolmogorov complexity), while the expected amount of generated heat is infinite. We also show that any computable realization faces a fundamental trade-off among heat generation, the Kolmogorov complexity of its heat function, and the Kolmogorov complexity of its input-output map. We demonstrate this trade-off by analyzing the thermodynamics of erasing a long string.},

Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit. Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

Spectral analysis based on autoregressive Burg method is first used to quantify the power distribution of EEG series in the frequency domain. Compared with the control group, the relative PSD of AD group is significantly higher in the theta frequency band while lower in the alpha frequency bands. In order to explore the nonlinear information, Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and multi-scale LZC is further applied to all electrodes for the four frequency bands. Analysis results demonstrate that the group difference is significant in the alpha frequency band by LZC and multi-scale LZC analysis. However, the group difference of multi-scale LZC is much more remarkable, manifesting as more channels undergo notable changes, particularly in electrodes O1 and O2 in the occipital area. Moreover, the multi-scale LZC value provided a better classification between the two groups with an accuracy of 85.7 \%. In addition, we combine both features of the relative PSD and multi-scale LZC to discriminate AD patients from the normal controls by applying a support vector machine model in the alpha frequency band. It is indicated that the two groups can be clearly classified by the combined feature. Importantly, the accuracy of the classification is higher than that of any one feature, reaching 91.4 \%. The obtained results show that analysis of PSD and multi-scale LZC can be taken as a potential comprehensive measure to distinguish AD patients from the normal controls, which may benefit our understanding of the disease.},

In recent years, because brain signals have complex nonlinear dynamics, there has been growing interest in studying complex changes in the time series of brain signals in patients with AD. We reviewed studies of complexity analyses of single-channel time series from electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in AD and determined future research directions. A systematic literature search for 2000–2019 was performed in the Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 126 identified studies. Compared to healthy individuals, the signals from AD patients have less complexity and more predictable oscillations, which are found mainly in the left parietal, occipital, right frontal, and temporal regions. This complexity is considered a potential biomarker for accurately responding to the functional lesion in AD. The current review helps to reveal the patterns of dysfunction in the brains of patients with AD and to investigate whether signal complexity can be used as a biomarker to accurately respond to the functional lesion in AD. We proposed further studies in the signal complexities of AD patients, including investigating the reliability of complexity algorithms and the spatial patterns of signal complexity. In conclusion, the current review helps to better understand the complexity of abnormalities in the AD brain and provide useful information for AD diagnosis.},

Two different methods were used to estimate the regularity of the EEG background activity: spectral entropy (SpecEn) and sample entropy (SampEn).

The exact pathophysiology of depression is still enigmatic though various theories have been put forwarded. There are evidences showing that mitochondrial dysfunction in various brain regions is associated with depression. Recent findings have sparked renewed appreciation for the role of mitochondria in many intracellular processes coupled to synaptic plasticity and cellular resilience. New insights in depression pathophysiology are revolving around the impairment of neuroplasticity. Mitochondria have potential role in ATP production, intracellular Ca2+ signalling to establish membrane stability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance and to execute the complex processes of neurotransmission and plasticity. So understanding the various concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathogenesis of depression indubitably helps to generate novel and more targeted therapeutic approaches for depression treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The review was aimed to give a comprehensive insight on role of mitochondrial dysfunction in depression.
RESULT: Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and enhancing the mitochondrial functions might act as potential target for the treatment of depression.
CONCLUSION: Literature cited in this review highly supports the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in depression. As impairment in the mitochondrial functions lead to the generation of various insults that exaggerate the pathogenesis of depression. So, it is useful to study mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to mood disorders, synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis and enhancing the functions of mitochondria might show promiscuous effects in the treatment of depressed patients.},

	abstract = {A physiological level of oxygen/nitrogen free radicals and non-radical reactive species (collectively known as ROS/RNS) is termed oxidative eustress or "good stress" and is characterized by low to mild levels of oxidants involved in the regulation of various biochemical transformations such as carboxylation, hydroxylation, peroxidation, or modulation of signal transduction pathways such as Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and other processes. Increased levels of ROS/RNS, generated from both endogenous (mitochondria, NADPH oxidases) and/or exogenous sources (radiation, certain drugs, foods, cigarette smoking, pollution) result in a harmful condition termed oxidative stress ("bad stress"). Although it is widely accepted, that many chronic diseases are multifactorial in origin, they share oxidative stress as a common denominator. Here we review the importance of oxidative stress and the mechanisms through which oxidative stress contributes to the pathological states of an organism. Attention is focused on the chemistry of ROS and RNS (e.g. superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite), and their role in oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of oxidative stress biomarkers is also discussed. Oxidative stress contributes to the pathology of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, Down syndrome), psychiatric diseases (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), renal disease, lung disease (chronic pulmonary obstruction, lung cancer), and aging. The concerted action of antioxidants to ameliorate the harmful effect of oxidative stress is achieved by antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutases-SODs, catalase, glutathione peroxidase-GPx), and small molecular weight antioxidants (vitamins C and E, flavonoids, carotenoids, melatonin, ergothioneine, and others). Perhaps one of the most effective low molecular weight antioxidants is vitamin E, the first line of defense against the peroxidation of lipids. A promising approach appears to be the use of certain antioxidants (e.g. flavonoids), showing weak prooxidant properties that may boost cellular antioxidant systems and thus act as preventive anticancer agents. Redox metal-based enzyme mimetic compounds as potential pharmaceutical interventions and sirtuins as promising therapeutic targets for age-related diseases and anti-aging strategies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Mood disorders are associated with elevated inflammation, and the reduction of symptoms after multiple treatments is often accompanied by pro-inflammation restoration. A variety of neuromodulation techniques that regulate regional brain activities have been used to treat refractory mood disorders. However, their efficacy varies from person to person and lack reliable indicator. This review summarizes clinical and animal studies on inflammation in neural circuits related to anxiety and depression and the evidence that neuromodulation therapies regulate neuroinflammation in the treatment of neurological diseases. Neuromodulation therapies, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), photobiomodulation (PBM), transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), all have been reported to attenuate neuroinflammation and reduce the release of pro-inflammatory factors, which may be one of the reasons for mood improvement. This review provides a better understanding of the effective mechanism of neuromodulation therapies and indicates that inflammatory biomarkers may serve as a reference for the assessment of pathological conditions and treatment options in anxiety and depression.},

It is now well established that dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems occur in depressed patients and hinder favorable prognosis, including antidepressant responses. In this review, we describe how the immune system regulates mood and the potential causes of the dysregulated inflammatory responses in depressed patients. However, the proportion of never-treated major depressive disorder (MDD) patients who exhibit inflammation remains to be clarified, as the heterogeneity in inflammation findings may stem in part from examining MDD patients with varied interventions. Inflammation is likely a critical disease modifier, promoting susceptibility to depression. Controlling inflammation might provide an overall therapeutic benefit, regardless of whether it is secondary to early life trauma, a more acute stress response, microbiome alterations, a genetic diathesis, or a combination of these and other factors.},

Alpha and aperiodic attractors are the least complex, and their global shapes are shared among all other frequency bands, affording alpha and aperiodic greater predictive power. Older adults show lower geometric complexity but greater coupling, resulting from dedifferentiation of gamma activity. The form and content of resting-state thoughts were further associated with the complexity of attractor dynamics. These findings support a process-developmental perspective on the brain's dynamic core, whereby more complex information differentiates out of an integrative and global geometric core.},

The spiking frequency was measured by extracellular recordings in layer 4. Changes in all three parameters (CMR(O2), nu, and S) were greater from the lower baseline (i.e., deeper anesthesia). For both baselines, DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2) and Deltanu/nu were approximately one order of magnitude larger than DeltaS/S. The final values of CMR(O2) and nu reached during stimulation were approximately the same from both baselines. If only increments were required to support functions then their magnitudes should be independent of the baseline. In contrast, if particular magnitudes of activity were required, then sizes of increments should inversely correlate with the baseline (being larger from a lower baseline). The results show that particular magnitudes of activity support neural function. The disregard of baseline activity in fMRI experiments by differencing removes a large and necessary component of the total activity. Implications of these results for understanding brain function and fMRI experiments are discussed.},

Extracellular recordings were used to measure changes in cerebral spiking frequency (Deltanu/nu) of a neuronal ensemble during forepaw stimulation in the alpha-chloralose anesthetized rat. Under the same conditions localized changes in brain energy metabolism (DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2)) were obtained from BOLD fMRI data in conjunction with measured changes in cerebral blood flow (DeltaCBF/CBF), cerebral blood volume (DeltaCBV/CBV), and transverse relaxation rates of tissue water (T(2)(*) and T(2)) by MRI methods at 7T. On stimulation from two different depths of anesthesia DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2) approximately Deltanu/nu. Previous (13)C magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, under similar conditions, had shown that DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2) was proportional to changes in glutamatergic neurotransmitter flux (DeltaV(cyc)/V(cyc)). These combined results show that DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2) approximately DeltaV(cyc)/V(cyc) approximately Deltanu/nu, thereby relating the energetic basis of brain activity to neuronal spiking frequency and neurotransmitter flux. Because DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2) had the same high spatial and temporal resolutions of the fMRI signal, these results show how BOLD imaging, when converted to DeltaCMR(O2)/CMR(O2), responds to localized changes in neuronal spike frequency.},

Twenty years later, thanks to the massive use of subcellular patch-clamp techniques, simultaneous multiple-cell recording, optogenetics, in vivo measurements, and computational approaches, our knowledge about PV(+) interneurons became more extensive than for several types of pyramidal neurons. These findings have implications beyond the "small world" of basic research on GABAergic cells. For example, the results provide a first proof of principle that neuroscientists might be able to close the gaps between the molecular, cellular, network, and behavioral levels, representing one of the main challenges at the present time.

	abstract = {Fast-spiking, inhibitory interneurons - prototype is the parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cell - generate action potentials at high frequency and synchronize the activity of numerous excitatory principal neurons, such as pyramidal cells, during fast network oscillations by rhythmic inhibition. For this purpose, fast-spiking, PV+ interneurons have unique electrophysiological characteristics regarding action potential kinetics and ion conductances, which are associated with high energy expenditure. This is reflected in the neural ultrastructure by enrichment with mitochondria and cytochrome c oxidase, indicating the dependence on oxidative phosphorylation for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) generation. The high energy expenditure is most likely required for membrane ion transport in dendrites and the extensive axon arbor as well as for presynaptic release of neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Fast-spiking, PV+ interneurons are central for the emergence of gamma oscillations (30-100Hz) that provide a fundamental mechanism of complex information processing during sensory perception, motor behavior and memory formation in networks of the hippocampus and the neocortex. Conversely, shortage in glucose and oxygen supply (metabolic stress) and/or excessive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (oxidative stress) may render these interneurons to be a vulnerable target. Dysfunction in fast-spiking, PV+ interneurons might set a low threshold for impairment of fast network oscillations and thus higher brain functions. This pathophysiological mechanism might be highly relevant for cerebral aging as well as various acute and chronic brain diseases, such as stroke, vascular cognitive impairment, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.},

This review discusses the main players in brain immunity as well as how inflammation interacts with the above three mechanisms. It is reported that kynurenine (KYN) pathway alteration in favour of its excitotoxic component and HPA axis dysregulation have the common effect of increasing extracellular glutamate levels and glutamate neurotransmission, which can impact hippocampal neurogenesis. This pathophysiological cascade appears to be triggered or sustained and reinforced by any chronic inflammatory condition involving increased circulating markers of inflammation that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and activate microglia; it can also be the consequence of primary brain neuroinflammation, such as in neurodegenerative disorders with early manifestations that are frequently depressive symptoms. Further recent data indicate that primary microglial activation may also result from a direct impact of chronic stress on vascular function. The intricated dynamic crosstalk between neuroinflammation and other relevant neurobiological correlates of depression add to evidence that neuroinflammation may be a key therapeutic target for future therapeutic strategies in major depressive disorder.},

Neuroprogression is the term used to describe the changes in several psychiatric conditions evidenced and observed in the clinical manifestations, biochemical markers, and cerebral structures of the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which frequently overlap with neurodegenerative disorders. DD is considered a potentially aggressive state of neuronal deterioration involving apoptosis, reduced neurogenesis, decreased neuronal plasticity, and increased immune response.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brexanolone (allopregnanolone) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postpartum depression, demonstrating long-lasting antidepressant effects. Despite our understanding of the mechanism of action of neurosteroids as positive allosteric modulators of GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid A) receptors, we still do not fully understand how allopregnanolone exerts persistent antidepressant effects.
METHODS: We used electroencephalogram recordings in rats and humans along with local field potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and behavioral tests in mice to assess the impact of neurosteroids on network states in brain regions implicated in mood and used optogenetic manipulations to directly examine their relationship to behavioral states.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that allopregnanolone and synthetic neuroactive steroid analogs with molecular pharmacology similar to allopregnanolone (SGE-516 [tool compound] and zuranolone [SAGE-217, investigational compound]) modulate oscillations across species. We further demonstrated a critical role for interneurons in generating oscillations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and a role for δ-containing GABAA receptors in mediating the ability of neurosteroids to modulate network and behavioral states. Allopregnanolone in the BLA enhances BLA high theta oscillations (6-12 Hz) through δ-containing GABAA receptors, a mechanism distinct from other GABAA positive allosteric modulators, such as benzodiazepines, and alters behavioral states. Treatment with the allopregnanolone analog SGE-516 protects mice from chronic stress-induced disruption of network and behavioral states, which is correlated with the modulation of theta oscillations in the BLA. Optogenetic manipulation of the network state influences the behavioral state after chronic unpredictable stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a novel molecular and cellular mechanism mediating the well-established anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of neuroactive steroids.},

Building on the platform of neuroimaging evidence on brain circuit models, magnetoencephalography, scalp electroencephalography, and even invasive electroencephalography are now being used to characterize brain network dysfunctions that underlie major depressive disorder using brain oscillation measurements and associated treatment responses. Such multiple encephalography modalities provide avenues to study pathologic network dynamics with high temporal resolution and over long time courses, opportunities to complement neuroimaging methods and findings, and new approaches to identify quantitative biomarkers that indicate critical targets for brain therapy. Such goals have been facilitated by the ongoing testing of novel invasive neuromodulation therapies, notably, deep brain stimulation, where clinically relevant treatment effects can be monitored at multiple brain sites in a time-locked causal manner. We review key brain rhythms identified in major depressive disorder as foundation for development of putative biomarkers for objectively evaluating neuromodulation success and for guiding deep brain stimulation or other target-based neuromodulation strategies for treatment-resistant depression patients.},

Olfactory bulbectomy, an established model of depression that reduces limbic gamma oscillations, suffers from non-specific effects of structural damage. Here, we show that transient functional suppression of olfactory bulb neurons or their piriform cortex efferents decreased gamma oscillation power in limbic areas and induced depression-like behaviors in rodents. Enhancing transmission of gamma oscillations from olfactory bulb to limbic structures by closed-loop electrical neuromodulation alleviated these behaviors. By contrast, silencing gamma transmission by anti-phase closed-loop stimulation strengthened depression-like behaviors in naive animals. These induced behaviors were neutralized by ketamine treatment that restored limbic gamma power. Taken together, our results reveal a causal link between limbic gamma oscillations and depression-like behaviors in rodents. Interfering with these endogenous rhythms can affect behaviors in rodent models of depression, suggesting that restoring gamma oscillations may alleviate depressive symptoms.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, exploring alternative strategies is crucial to understanding and developing more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has received significant attention in the AD field.

However, studies in this area are still in their infancy, and many aspects of this field are just beginning to be explored and understood. Gaining a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions and signaling pathways involved in the microbiota-AD interaction is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies targeting gut microbiota to positively impact AD. In this review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD. We will discuss the existing evidence regarding the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis, suggested underlying mechanisms, biological factors influencing the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AD, and remaining questions in the field. Last, we will discuss potential therapeutic approaches to recondition the community of gut microbiota to alleviate disease progression. An ongoing exploration of the gut-brain axis and the development of microbiota-based therapies hold the potential for advancing AD management in the future.},

Various microbes have been identified in the postmortem brain tissues of human AD patients.

However, no definitive studies have been performed proving or disproving Cp's role as a causative or accelerating agent in AD pathology and cognitive decline.

We discuss major mechanistic players associated with the APOE alleles’ effects in humans to understand their impact from conception through all life stages and the importance of detrimental, synergistic environmental exposures. APOE4 influences AD pathogenesis, and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), manufactured nanoparticles (NPs), and ultrafine particles (UFPs) associated with combustion and friction processes appear to be major contributors to cerebrovascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. In the context of outdoor and indoor PM pollution burden—as well as Fe, Ti, and Al alloys; Hg, Cu, Ca, Sn, and Si UFPs/NPs—in placenta and fetal brain tissues, urban APOE3 and APOE4 carriers are developing AD biological disease hallmarks (hyperphosphorylated-tau (P-tau) and amyloid beta 42 plaques (Aβ42)). Strikingly, for Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) young residents ≤ 40 y, APOE4 carriers have 4.92 times higher suicide odds and 23.6 times higher odds of reaching Braak NFT V stage versus APOE4 non-carriers. The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) framework could serve to test the hypothesis that UFPs and NPs are key players for oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and misfolding, faulty complex protein quality control, and early damage to cell membranes and organelles of neural and vascular cells. Noninvasive biomarkers indicative of the P-tau and Aβ42 abnormal protein deposits are needed across the disease continuum starting in childhood. Among the 21.8 million MMC residents, we have potentially 4 million APOE4 carriers at accelerated AD progression. These APOE4 individuals are prime candidates for early neuroprotective interventional trials. APOE4 is key in the development of AD evolving from childhood in highly polluted urban centers dominated by anthropogenic and industrial sources of pollution. APOE4 subjects are at higher early risk of AD development, and neuroprotection ought to be implemented. Effective reductions of PM2.5, UFP, and NP emissions from all sources are urgently needed. Alzheimer’s Disease prevention ought to be at the core of the public health response and physicians-scientist minority research be supported.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a major component of ambient air pollution (AAP), being widely associated with adverse health effects. Epidemiological and experimental studies point towards a clear implication of AAP on the development of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this sense, the period of most CNS susceptibility is early life, when the CNS is maturing. In humans the last trimester of gestation is crucial for brain maturation while in rodents, due to the shorter gestational period, the brain is still immature at birth, and early postnatal development plays a significant role. The present systematic review provides an updated overview and discusses the existing literature on the relationship between early exposure to PM and neurodevelopmental outcomes in experimental studies. We included 11 studies with postnatal exposure and 9 studies with both prenatal and postnatal exposure. Consistent results between studies suggest that PM exposure could alter normal development, triggering impairments in short-term memory, sociability, and impulsive-like behavior. This is also associated with alterations in synaptic plasticity and in the immune system. Interestingly, differences have been observed between sexes, although not all studies included females. Furthermore, the developmental window of exposure seems to be crucial for effects to be observed in the future. In summary, air pollution exposure during development affects subjects in a time- and sex-dependent manner, the postnatal period being more important and being males apparently more sensitive to exposure than females. Nevertheless, additional experimental investigations should prioritize the examination of learning, impulsivity, and biochemical parameters, with particular attention provided to disparities between sexes.},

	abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a "research framework" because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

RECENT FINDINGS: Important recent advances for CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers include the introduction of fully automated assays, the development and implementation of certified reference materials for CSF Aβ42 and a unified protocol for handling of samples, which all support reliability and availability of CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. Aβ deposition can be detected using Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in both CSF and plasma, though a much more modest change is seen in plasma. Tau aggregation can be detected using phosphorylated tau (P-tau) at threonine 181 and 217 in CSF, with similar accuracy in plasma. Neurofilament light (NfL) be measured in CSF and shows similar diagnostic accuracy in plasma. Though total tau (T-tau) can also be measured in plasma, this measure is of limited clinical relevance for Alzheimer's disease in its current immunoassay format.
SUMMARY: Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, including Aβ, P-tau and NfL can now be reliably measured in both CSF and blood. Plasma-based measures of P-tau show particular promise, with potential applications in both clinical practice and in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution may increase dementia risk in older adults. Although this evidence suggests opportunities for intervention, little is known about the relative importance of PM2.5 from different emission sources.
OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of long-term exposure of total and source-specific PM2.5 with incident dementia in older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Environmental Predictors of Cognitive Health and Aging study used biennial survey data from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2016, for participants in the Health and Retirement Study, which is a nationally representative, population-based cohort study in the US. The present cohort study included all participants older than 50 years who were without dementia at baseline and had available exposure, outcome, and demographic data between 1998 and 2016 (N = 27 857). Analyses were performed from January 31 to May 1, 2022.
EXPOSURES: The 10-year mean total PM2.5 and PM2.5 from 9 emission sources at participant residences for each month during follow-up using spatiotemporal and chemical transport models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was incident dementia as classified by a validated algorithm incorporating respondent-based cognitive testing and proxy respondent reports. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for incident dementia per IQR of residential PM2.5 concentrations using time-varying, weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment for the individual- and area-level risk factors.
RESULTS: Among 27 857 participants (mean [SD] age, 61 [10] years; 15 747 [56.5\%] female), 4105 (15\%) developed dementia during a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.2 [5.6] years. Higher concentrations of total PM2.5 were associated with greater rates of incident dementia (HR, 1.08 per IQR; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.17). In single pollutant models, PM2.5 from all sources, except dust, were associated with increased rates of dementia, with the strongest associations for agriculture, traffic, coal combustion, and wildfires. After control for PM2.5 from all other sources and copollutants, only PM2.5 from agriculture (HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.27) and wildfires (HR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.08) were robustly associated with greater rates of dementia.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, higher residential PM2.5 levels, especially from agriculture and wildfires, were associated with higher rates of incident dementia, providing further evidence supporting PM2.5 reduction as a population-based approach to promote healthy cognitive aging. These findings also indicate that intervening on key emission sources might have value, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.},

Toxic proteases from the bacterium called gingipains were also identified in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, and levels correlated with tau and ubiquitin pathology. Oral P. gingivalis infection in mice resulted in brain colonization and increased production of Aβ1–42, a component of amyloid plaques. Further, gingipains were neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro, exerting detrimental effects on tau, a protein needed for normal neuronal function. To block this neurotoxicity, we designed and synthesized small-molecule inhibitors targeting gingipains. Gingipain inhibition reduced the bacterial load of an established P. gingivalis brain infection, blocked Aβ1–42 production, reduced neuroinflammation, and rescued neurons in the hippocampus. These data suggest that gingipain inhibitors could be valuable for treating P. gingivalis brain colonization and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder influenced by age, sex, genetic factors, immune alterations, and infections. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that changes in antibody response are linked to AD pathology.
METHODS: To elucidate the mechanisms underlying AD development, we investigated antibodies that target autoimmune epitopes using high-resolution epitope microarrays. Our study compared two groups: individuals with AD (n = 19) and non-demented (ND) controls (n = 19). To validate the results, we measured antibody levels in plasma samples from AD patients (n = 96), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 91), and ND controls (n = 97). To further explore the invlovement of EBV, we performed epitope masking immunofluorescence microscopy analysis and tests to induce lytic replication using the B95-8 cell line.
RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed high-resolution epitope-specific serum antibody levels in AD, revealing significant disparities in antibodies targeting multiple epitopes between the AD and control groups. Particularly noteworthy was the significant down-regulation of antibody (anti-DG\#29) targeting an epitope of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). This down-regulation increased AD risk in female patients (odds ratio up to 6.6), but not in male patients. Our investigation further revealed that the down-regulation of the antibody (anti-DG\#29) is associated with EBV reactivation in AD, as indicated by the analysis of EBV VCA IgG or IgM levels. Additionally, our data demonstrated that the epitope region on EBNA1 for the antibody is hidden during the EBV lytic reactivation of B95-8 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a potential relationship of EBV in the development of AD in female. Moreover, we propose that antibodies targeting the epitope (DG\#29) of EBNA1 could serve as valuable indicators of AD risk in female.},

	abstract = {Chronic viral infection is implicated in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our goal was to identify biomarkers for the development of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from cognitively normal state. To accomplish this, we analyzed plasma IgG levels against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) in study subjects with incident aMCI (Converter) and normal cognitive function (NC Control) who did or did not convert from cognitively normal state to aMCI during the 2-year follow-up period, respectively. The Converter group exhibited elevated levels of anti-EBV IgG antibodies in the post-follow-up phase (aMCI state) compared to the pre-follow-up phase (cognitively normal state), but not the NC Control group. In contrast, the total IgG level was not significantly changed over the follow-up period. Moreover, elevated anti-EBV IgG levels were significantly associated with CDR scales and total CERAD scores in the Converter group. These results suggest that EBV infection or its related host immune response is linked to cognitive decline. Thus, an EBV antibody level may be used as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of aMCI development, implying a role for chronic EBV infection in AD pathogenesis.},

Additionally, more and more epidemiological evidence implicates the cell-cycle dysregulation in neurodegeneration. Numerous hypotheses which describe the triggers that force post-mitotic neurons to re-enter the cell cycle are prevalent. Apart from the known genetic and epigenetic factors responsible, several reports have shown the association of microbial infections with neurodegenerative pathology. Although, studies implicating the herpesvirus family members in neurodegeneration exist, the involvement of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), in particular, is under-evaluated. Interestingly, a few clinical studies have reported patients of AD or PD to be seropositive for EBV. Based on the findings mentioned above, in this review, we propose that EBV infection in neurons could drive it towards neurodegeneration through dysregulation of cell-cycle events and induction of apoptosis.},

Others have aimed to explain the mechanisms in cells whereby the increase in amyloid-beta (Aβ) production on HSV1 infection of cells and mouse brains occurs, and the reason that infected cells make this increase. The possibility that other herpesviruses are involved in the development of AD has been explored, and human herpesvirus type 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus, in particular, have been implicated. Epidemiological studies have further supported the role specifically of HSV1 and its reactivation in the disease. Antiviral studies have continued, comparing those acting by different mechanisms, such as restricting viral replication, or blocking viral entry into cells, to treat HSV1-infected cell cultures, and then examining the extent to which the virus-induced increases in Aβ and AD-like tau are reduced.

	abstract = {The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide has long been considered to be the driving force behind Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, clinical trials that have successfully reduced Aβ burden in the brain have not slowed the cognitive decline, and in some instances, have resulted in adverse outcomes. While these results can be interpreted in different ways, a more nuanced picture of Aβ is emerging that takes into account the facts that the peptide is evolutionarily conserved and is present throughout life in cognitively normal individuals. Recent evidence indicates a role for Aβ as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP), a class of innate immune defense molecule that utilizes fibrillation to protect the host from a wide range of infectious agents. In humans and in animal models, infection of the brain frequently leads to increased amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and resultant fibrillary aggregates of Aβ. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrates that Aβ oligomers have potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties by forming fibrils that entrap pathogens and disrupt cell membranes. Importantly, overexpression of Aβ confers increased resistance to infection from both bacteria and viruses. The antimicrobial role of Aβ may explain why increased rates of infection have been observed in some of the AD clinical trials that depleted Aβ. Perhaps progress toward a cure for AD will accelerate once treatment strategies begin to take into account the likely physiological functions of this enigmatic peptide.},

	abstract = {Background The amyloid β-protein (Aβ) is believed to be the key mediator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Aβ is most often characterized as an incidental catabolic byproduct that lacks a normal physiological role. However, Aβ has been shown to be a specific ligand for a number of different receptors and other molecules, transported by complex trafficking pathways, modulated in response to a variety of environmental stressors, and able to induce pro-inflammatory activities. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we provide data supporting an in vivo function for Aβ as an antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Experiments used established in vitro assays to compare antimicrobial activities of Aβ and LL-37, an archetypical human AMP. Findings reveal that Aβ exerts antimicrobial activity against eight common and clinically relevant microorganisms with a potency equivalent to, and in some cases greater than, LL-37. Furthermore, we show that AD whole brain homogenates have significantly higher antimicrobial activity than aged matched non-AD samples and that AMP action correlates with tissue Aβ levels. Consistent with Aβ-mediated activity, the increased antimicrobial action was ablated by immunodepletion of AD brain homogenates with anti-Aβ antibodies. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest Aβ is a hitherto unrecognized AMP that may normally function in the innate immune system. This finding stands in stark contrast to current models of Aβ-mediated pathology and has important implications for ongoing and future AD treatment strategies.},

Changes in brain functional connectivity (FC) could accompany this decline in the DR performance even in a resting state condition from the preclinical stages to the diagnosis of AD itself, so the characterization of the relationship between the two phenomena has attracted increasing interest. Another aspect to contemplate is the potential moderator role of the APOE genotype in this association, considering the evidence about their implication for the disease. 379 subjects (118 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 261 cognitively intact (CI) individuals) underwent an extensive evaluation, including MEG recording. Applying cluster-based permutation test, we identified a cluster of differences in FC and studied which connections drove such an effect in DR. The moderation effect of APOE genotype between FC results and delayed recall was evaluated too. Higher FC in beta band in the right occipital region is associated with lower DR scores in both groups. A significant anteroposterior link emerged in the seed-based analysis with higher values in MCI. Moreover, APOE genotype appeared as a moderator between beta FC and DR performance only in the CI group. An increased beta FC in the anteroposterior brain region appears to be associated with lower memory performance in MCI. This finding could help discriminate the pattern of the progression of healthy aging to MCI and the relation between resting state and memory performance.},

Moreover, this is the first work to correlate electrophysiological measures with plasma p-tau231 levels, a known pathology marker, to interpret the nature of the change. We evaluated 69 cognitively unimpaired individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease and 28 without, at two different time points, approximately 3 years apart, including resting state magnetoencephalography recordings and plasma p-tau231 determinations. Functional connectivity changes in both precunei and left anterior cingulate cortex in the high-alpha band were studied using non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests. Connectivity values were correlated with p-tau231 levels. Three clusters emerged in individuals with family history, exhibiting a longitudinal increase of connectivity. Notably, the clusters for both precunei bore a striking resemblance to those found in previous cross-sectional studies. The connectivity values at follow-up and the change in connectivity in the left precuneus cluster showed significant positive correlations with p-tau231. This study consolidates the use of electrophysiology, in combination with plasma biomarkers, to monitor healthy individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease and emphasizes the value of combining noninvasive markers to understand the underlying mechanisms and track disease progression.

While animal models have verified this idea extensively, there is still no clear evidence in humans. Here we test this hypothesis, evaluating the risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease in a longitudinal study. We compared the functional resting state eyes-closed magnetoencephalographic networks of 54 patients with MCI who were followed-up every 6 months. According to their clinical outcome, they were split into: (i) the 'progressive' MCI (n = 27) group; and (ii) the 'stable' MCI group (n = 27). They did not differ in gender or educational level. For all participants, two magnetoencephalographic recordings were acquired. Functional connectivity was evaluated using the phase locking value. To extract the functional connectivity network with significant changes between both magnetoencephalographic recordings, we evaluated the functional connectivity ratio, defined as functional connectivity post-/pre-condition, in a network-based statistical model with an ANCOVA test with age as covariate. Two significant networks were found in the theta and beta bands, involving fronto-temporal and fronto-occipital connections, and showing a diminished functional connectivity ratio in the progressive MCI group. These topologies were then evaluated at each condition showing that at baseline, patients with progressive MCI showed higher synchronization than patients with stable MCI, while in the post-condition this pattern was reversed. These results may be influenced by two main factors in the post-condition: the increased synchrony in the stable MCI patients and the network failure in the progressive MCI patients. These findings may be explained as an 'X' form model where the hypersynchrony predicts conversion, leading subsequently to a network breakdown in progressive MCI. Patients with stable MCI showed an opposite phenomenon, which could indicate that they were a step beyond in the Alzheimer's disease continuum. This model would be able to predict the risk for the conversion to dementia in MCI patients.},

There is a growing interest in detecting AD pathology in the brain in the very early stages of the disorder. Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) could represent a preclinical asymptomatic stage of AD but very little is known about this population. In the present work we assessed whether FC disruptions are already present in this stage, and if they share any spatial distribution properties with MCI alterations (a condition known to be highly related to AD). To this end, we measured electromagnetic spontaneous activity with MEG in 39 healthy control elders, 41 elders with SCD and 51 MCI patients. The results showed FC alterations in both SCD and MCI compared to the healthy control group. Interestingly, both groups exhibited a very similar spatial pattern of altered links: a hyper-synchronized anterior network and a posterior network characterized by a decrease in FC. This decrease was more pronounced in the MCI group. These results highlight that elders with SCD present FC alterations. More importantly, those disruptions affected AD typically related areas and showed great overlap with the alterations exhibited by MCI patients. These results support the consideration of SCD as a preclinical stage of AD and may indicate that FC alterations appear very early in the course of the disease.},

We suggest that during this very extended early phase of the disease, soluble Aβ oligomers and amyloid plaques alter the function of local neuronal circuits and large-scale networks by disrupting the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) in the brain. The analysis of mouse models of AD revealed that an Aβ-induced change of the E/I balance caused hyperactivity in cortical and hippocampal neurons, a breakdown of slow-wave oscillations, as well as network hypersynchrony. Remarkably, hyperactivity of hippocampal neurons precedes amyloid plaque formation, suggesting that hyperactivity is one of the earliest dysfunctions in the pathophysiological cascade initiated by abnormal Aβ accumulation. Therapeutics that correct the E/I balance in early AD may prevent neuronal dysfunction, widespread cell loss and cognitive impairments associated with later stages of the disease.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP together to control life and death'.},

	abstract = {One of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of plaques in the cerebral cortex, which may appear either in the neuropil or in direct association with neuronal somata. Since different axonal systems innervate the dendritic (mostly glutamatergic) and perisomatic (mostly GABAergic) regions of neurons, the accumulation of plaques in the neuropil or associated with the soma might produce different alterations to synaptic circuits. We have used a variety of conventional light, confocal and electron microscopy techniques to study their relationship with neuronal somata in the cerebral cortex from AD patients and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The main finding was that the membrane surfaces of neurons (mainly pyramidal cells) in contact with plaques lack GABAergic perisomatic synapses. Since these perisomatic synapses are thought to exert a strong influence on the output of pyramidal cells, their loss may lead to the hyperactivity of the neurons in contact with plaques. These results suggest that plaques modify circuits in a more selective manner than previously thought.},

Recently, translational studies have begun to connect the dots between protein alterations and deposition, brain network dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Disturbance of neuronal activity, and in particular an imbalance in underlying excitation/inhibition (E/I), appears early in AD, and can be regarded as forming a central link between structural brain pathology and cognitive dysfunction. While there are emerging (non-)pharmacological options to influence this imbalance, the complexity of human brain dynamics has hindered identification of an optimal approach.

	abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the future challenges of meeting care demands for the growing number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States with a particular emphasis on primary care. By mid-century, the number of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia may grow to 13.8 million. This represents a steep increase from the estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's dementia today. Official death certificates recorded 122,019 deaths from AD in 2018, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2\%. In 2019, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly \$244 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \$305 billion. As the population of Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia increases, the burden of caring for that population also increases. These challenges are exacerbated by a shortage of dementia care specialists, which places an increasing burden on primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide care for people living with dementia. Many PCPs feel underprepared and inadequately trained to handle dementia care responsibilities effectively. This report includes recommendations for maximizing quality care in the face of the shortage of specialists and training challenges in primary care.},

	abstract = {The concept of cognitive impairment intervening between normal ageing and very early dementia has been in the literature for many years. Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations.},

The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical AD, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of AD when some disease-modifying therapies may be most efficacious.},

Individual alpha frequency peak (IAF) determined the delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 frequency bands. Fixed beta 1, beta 2, and gamma bands were also considered. rsEEG cortical sources were estimated by means of the exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic source tomography and were then classified across individuals, on the basis of the receiver operating characteristic curves. Compared to Nold, IAF showed marked slowing in PDD and DLB and moderate slowing in ADD. Furthermore, all patient groups showed lower posterior alpha 2 source activities. This effect was dramatic in ADD, marked in DLB, and moderate in PDD. These groups also showed higher occipital delta source activities, but this effect was dramatic in PDD, marked in DLB, and moderate in ADD. The posterior delta and alpha sources allowed good classification accuracy (approximately 0.85-0.90) between the Nold subjects and patients, and between ADD and PDD patients. In quiet wakefulness, delta and alpha sources unveiled different spatial and frequency features of the cortical neural synchronization underpinning brain arousal in ADD, PDD, and DLB patients. Future prospective cross-validation studies should test these rsEEG markers for clinical applications and drug discovery.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) is a largely unknown state thought to represent a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) previous to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the course of network disruption in these stages is scarcely characterized.
METHODS: We employed resting state magnetoencephalography in the source space to calculate network smallworldness, clustering, modularity and transitivity. Nodal measures (clustering and node degree) as well as modular partitions were compared between groups.
RESULTS: The MCI group exhibited decreased smallworldness, clustering and transitivity and increased modularity in theta and beta bands. SCD showed similar but smaller changes in clustering and transitivity, while exhibiting alterations in the alpha band in opposite direction to those showed by MCI for modularity and transitivity. At the node level, MCI disrupted both clustering and nodal degree while SCD showed minor changes in the latter. Additionally, we observed an increase in modular partition variability in both SCD and MCI in theta and beta bands.
CONCLUSION: SCD elders exhibit a significant network disruption, showing intermediate values between HC and MCI groups in multiple parameters. These results highlight the relevance of cognitive concerns in the clinical setting and suggest that network disorganization in AD could start in the preclinical stages before the onset of cognitive symptoms.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly with a progressive decline in cognitive function significantly affecting quality of life. Both the prevalence and emotional and financial burdens of AD on patients, their families, and society are predicted to grow significantly in the near future, due to a prolongation of the lifespan. Several lines of evidence suggest that modifications of risk-enhancing life styles and initiation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments in the early stage of disease, although not able to modify its course, helps to maintain personal autonomy in daily activities and significantly reduces the total costs of disease management. Moreover, many clinical trials with potentially disease-modifying drugs are devoted to prodromal stages of AD. Thus, the identification of markers of conversion from prodromal form to clinically AD may be crucial for developing strategies of early interventions. The current available markers, including volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis are expensive, poorly available in community health facilities, and relatively invasive. Taking into account its low cost, widespread availability and non-invasiveness, electroencephalography (EEG) would represent a candidate for tracking the prodromal phases of cognitive decline in routine clinical settings eventually in combination with other markers. In this scenario, the present paper provides an overview of epidemiology, genetic risk factors, neuropsychological, fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in AD and describes the potential role of EEG in AD investigation, trying in particular to point out whether advanced analysis of EEG rhythms exploring brain function has sufficient specificity/sensitivity/accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD.},

We further applied a resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)-driven model of source reconstruction and tested its advantage in terms of AD diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with AD dementia (ADD), 86 amnestic MCI, and 33 healthy subjects enter the EEG study. All ADD subjects, 37 out of 86 MCI patients and a distinct group of 53 healthy controls further entered the fMRI study. MCI subjects were divided according to the CSF phosphorylated tau/β amyloid-42 ratio (MCIpos: ≥ 0.13, MCIneg: {\textless} 0.13). Using Exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), EEG lobar current densities were estimated at fixed frequencies and analyzed. To combine the two imaging techniques, networks mostly affected by AD pathology were identified using Independent Component Analysis applied to fMRI data of ADD subjects. Current density EEG analysis within ICA-based networks at selected frequency bands was performed. Afterwards, graph analysis was applied to EEG and fMRI data at ICA-based network level.
RESULTS: ADD patients showed a widespread slowing of spectral density. At a lobar level, MCIpos subjects showed a widespread higher theta density than MCIneg and healthy subjects; a lower beta2 density than healthy subjects was also found in parietal and occipital lobes. Evaluating EEG sources within the ICA-based networks, alpha2 band distinguished MCIpos from MCIneg, ADD and healthy subjects with good accuracy. Graph analysis on EEG data showed an alteration of connectome configuration at theta frequency in ADD and MCIpos patients and a progressive disruption of connectivity at alpha2 frequency throughout the AD continuum.
CONCLUSIONS: Theta frequency is the earliest and most sensitive EEG marker of AD pathology. Furthermore, EEG/fMRI integration highlighted the role of alpha2 band as potential neurodegeneration biomarker.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and intellectual deficits and behavior disturbance. The electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a tool for diagnosing AD for several decades. The hallmark of EEG abnormalities in AD patients is a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies and a decrease in coherence of fast rhythms. These abnormalities are thought to be associated with functional disconnections among cortical areas resulting from death of cortical neurons, axonal pathology, cholinergic deficits, etc. This article reviews main findings of EEG abnormalities in AD patients obtained from conventional spectral analysis and nonlinear dynamical methods. In particular, nonlinear alterations in the EEG of AD patients, i.e. a decreased complexity of EEG patterns and reduced information transmission among cortical areas, and their clinical implications are discussed. For future studies, improvement of the accuracy of differential diagnosis and early detection of AD based on multimodal approaches, longitudinal studies on nonlinear dynamics of the EEG, drug effects on the EEG dynamics, and linear and nonlinear functional connectivity among cortical regions in AD are proposed to be investigated. EEG abnormalities of AD patients are characterized by slowed mean frequency, less complex activity, and reduced coherences among cortical regions. These abnormalities suggest that the EEG has utility as a valuable tool for differential and early diagnosis of AD.},

	abstract = {Cortical gray matter volume and resting state cortical electroencephalographic rhythms are typically abnormal in subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we tested the hypothesis that in amnesic MCI and AD subjects, abnormalities of EEG rhythms are a functional reflection of cortical atrophy across the disease. Eyes‐closed resting state EEG data were recorded in 57 healthy elderly (Nold), 102 amnesic MCI, and 108 AD patients. Cortical gray matter volume was indexed by magnetic resonance imaging recorded in the MCI and AD subjects according to Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative project (http://www.adni-info.org/). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha1 (8–10.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.5–13 Hz), beta1 (13–20 Hz), beta2 (20–30 Hz), and gamma (30–40 Hz). These rhythms were indexed by LORETA. Compared with the Nold, the MCI showed a decrease in amplitude of alpha 1 sources. With respect to the Nold and MCI, the AD showed an amplitude increase of delta sources, along with a strong amplitude reduction of alpha 1 sources. In the MCI and AD subjects as a whole group, the lower the cortical gray matter volume, the higher the delta sources, the lower the alpha 1 sources. The better the score to cognitive tests the higher the gray matter volume, the lower the pathological delta sources, and the higher the alpha sources. These results suggest that in amnesic MCI and AD subjects, abnormalities of resting state cortical EEG rhythms are not epiphenomena but are strictly related to neurodegeneration (atrophy of cortical gray matter) and cognition.

	abstract = {Perception, cognition, and social interaction depend upon coordinated neural activity. This coordination operates within noisy, overlapping, and distributed neural networks operating at multiple timescales. These networks are built upon a structural scaffolding with intrinsic neuroplasticity that changes with development, aging, disease, and personal experience. In this article, we begin from the perspective that successful interregional communication relies upon the transient synchronization between distinct low-frequency ({\textless}80 Hz) oscillations, allowing for brief windows of communication via phase-coordinated local neuronal spiking. From this, we construct a theoretical framework for dynamic network communication, arguing that these networks reflect a balance between oscillatory coupling and local population spiking activity and that these two levels of activity interact. We theorize that when oscillatory coupling is too strong, spike timing within the local neuronal population becomes too synchronous; when oscillatory coupling is too weak, spike timing is too disorganized. Each results in specific disruptions to neural communication. These alterations in communication dynamics may underlie cognitive changes associated with healthy development and aging, in addition to neurological and psychiatric disorders. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders-including Parkinson's disease, autism, depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety-are associated with abnormalities in oscillatory activity. Although aging, psychiatric and neurological disease, and experience differ in the biological changes to structural gray or white matter, neurotransmission, and gene expression, our framework suggests that any resultant cognitive and behavioral changes in normal or disordered states or their treatment are a product of how these physical processes affect dynamic network communication.},

The Panel reviewed the field literature. As most consistent findings, AD patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia showed abnormalities in peak frequency, power, and "interrelatedness" at posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) and widespread delta ({\textless} 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms in relation to disease progression and interventions. The following consensus statements were subscribed: (1) Standardization of instructions to patients, resting state EEG (rsEEG) recording methods, and selection of artifact-free rsEEG periods are needed; (2) power density and "interrelatedness" rsEEG measures (e.g., directed transfer function, phase lag index, linear lagged connectivity, etc.) at delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands may be use for stratification of AD patients and monitoring of disease progression and intervention; and (3) international multisectoral initiatives are mandatory for regulatory purposes.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers useful for the predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease are needed. Electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are expected to provide potential biomarker candidates for evaluating the predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, the physiological relevance of EEG/MEG signal changes and their role in pathophysiological processes such as amyloid-β deposition and neurodegeneration need to be elucidated. We evaluated 28 individuals with mild cognitive impairment and 38 cognitively normal individuals, all of whom were further classified into amyloid-β-positive mild cognitive impairment (n = 17, mean age 74.7 ± 5.4 years, nine males), amyloid-β-negative mild cognitive impairment (n = 11, mean age 73.8 ± 8.8 years, eight males), amyloid-β-positive cognitively normal (n = 13, mean age 71.8 ± 4.4 years, seven males), and amyloid-β-negative cognitively normal (n = 25, mean age 72.5 ± 3.4 years, 11 males) individuals using Pittsburgh compound B-PET. We measured resting state MEG for 5 min with the eyes closed, and investigated regional spectral patterns of MEG signals using atlas-based region of interest analysis. Then, the relevance of the regional spectral patterns and their associations with pathophysiological backgrounds were analysed by integrating information from Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, and cognitive tests. The results demonstrated that regional spectral patterns of resting state activity could be separated into several types of MEG signatures as follows: (i) the effects of amyloid-β deposition were expressed as the alpha band power augmentation in medial frontal areas; (ii) the delta band power increase in the same region was associated with disease progression within the Alzheimer's disease continuum and was correlated with entorhinal atrophy and an Alzheimer's disease-like regional decrease in glucose metabolism; and (iii) the global theta power augmentation, which was previously considered to be an Alzheimer's disease-related EEG/MEG signature, was associated with general cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy, but was not specific to Alzheimer's disease because these changes could be observed in the absence of amyloid-β deposition. The results suggest that these MEG signatures may be useful as unique biomarkers for the predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease.},

This chapter focusses on psychedelics that specifically target the 5-HT2A receptor such as psilocybin and DMT. These produce plasma-concentration related psychological effects such as hallucinations and out of body experiences, insightful and emotional breakthroughs as well as mystical-type experiences. When coupled with psychological support, effects can produce a rapid improvement in mood among people with depression that can last for months. In this chapter, we summarise the scientific studies to date that explore the use of psychedelics in depressed individuals, highlighting key clinical, psychological and neuroimaging features of psychedelics that may account for their therapeutic effects. These include alterations in brain entropy that disrupt fixed negative ruminations, a period of post-treatment increased cognitive flexibility, and changes in self-referential psychological processes. Finally, we propose that the brain mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of serotonergic psychedelics might be distinct from those underlying classical serotonin reuptake-blocking antidepressants.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a variant of noninvasive neuromodulation, which promises treatment for brain diseases like major depressive disorder. In experiments, long-lasting aftereffects were observed, suggesting that persistent plastic changes are induced. The mechanism underlying the emergence of lasting aftereffects, however, remains elusive. Here we propose a model, which assumes that tDCS triggers a homeostatic response of the network involving growth and decay of synapses. The cortical tissue exposed to tDCS is conceived as a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with synapses subject to homeostatically regulated structural plasticity. We systematically tested various aspects of stimulation, including electrode size and montage, as well as stimulation intensity and duration. Our results suggest that transcranial stimulation perturbs the homeostatic equilibrium and leads to a pronounced growth response of the network. The stimulated population eventually eliminates excitatory synapses with the unstimulated population, and new synapses among stimulated neurons are grown to form a cell assembly. Strong focal stimulation tends to enhance the connectivity within new cell assemblies, and repetitive stimulation with well-chosen duty cycles can increase the impact of stimulation even further. One long-term goal of our work is to help in optimizing the use of tDCS in clinical applications.Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques like tDCS have the potential to directly interfere with neural activity, but may also trigger activity-dependent plasticity. We propose a model to study the mechanism of tDCS and persistent aftereffects that may be induced as a consequence of homeostatic structural plasticity. Based on the idea that tDCS perturbs the ongoing activity of neurons, our model predicts that the stimulation also triggers a rearrangement of synapses among stimulated and unstimulated neurons, eventually leading to network remodeling and cell assembly formation. Focal and strong stimulation leads to stronger cell assemblies, and so does repetitive stimulation with optimized stimulation protocols. This is the first original work studying possible long-lasting aftereffects of transcranial stimulation at the mesoscopic neuronal network level using a computational model.},

	title = {Synchrony and amplitude modulation of cortical activity in humans performing manipulative visuomotor tasks},
	abstract = {Synchrony of oscillatory brain activity has been postulated to be a binding mechanism for cognitive and motor functions. Spectral analysis of human electrocorticogram (ECoG) in sensorimotor cortex has shown that power density of gamma band activity (30-60 Hz) increased and that of alpha-beta band activity (10-20 Hz) decreased during performance of manipulative visuomotor tasks, indicating that amplitude modulation of the gamma band activity occurred in relation to the task performance. Amplitude modulation may provide evidence for synchrony of local neuronal assembly. However, it does not implement the binding mechanisms for distributed networks that are necessary for cognitive and motor functions. To prove that oscillatory activity mediates a binding mechanism, phase modulation of oscillatory activity in a wide range area should be shown. We performed coherence analysis of the ECoG signals in sensorimotor cortex to study if synchrony of the gamma band activity between these areas occurs in relation to manipulative task performance. The ECoGs were recorded from 14 sites in sensorimotor cortex including hand-arm areas with subdural grid electrodes in four subjects. Coherence estimates in all pair-wise sites were calculated in different frequency bands with 10 Hz widths from 10 to 80 Hz. In all subjects, coherence estimates increased in the lower gamma band (20-50 Hz) during the performance of the manipulative tasks. But coherence in the alpha-beta band (10-20 Hz) also increased even though amplitude modulation did not occur in this frequency band. Coherence estimates increased in site pairs within and between sensory and motor areas, many separated by intervening sites. This interregional synchrony of the alpha-beta and the lower gamma activities may play a role in integration of sensorimotor information. Task-dependent increases in coherence estimates, i.e., greater increases during performance of the manipulative tasks than during the simple tasks, suggest another role of synchrony in attention mechanism. Time-series coherence analysis showed that phase modulation occurred in different timings for activities in the alpha-beta and the lower gamma bands. For the activity in higher gamma band (50-80 Hz), power density increased but coherence estimates decreased. Thus, only amplitude modulation occurred in this frequency band. Altogether these results suggest that oscillatory activities in different frequency bands may reflect different functional roles by modulating neural activity in different ways. available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.},

Spatio-temporal correlations were investigated in the 20-50 Hz range in search for similar phenomena in human ECoG. ECoGs were recorded in a somatosensory discrimination task from 64-electrode subdural grid arrays, with inter-electrode spacing of 1 cm, overlying somatosensory, motor and superior temporal cortices in 2 patients with intractable epilepsy. Bootstrap techniques were devised to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the correlations. Despite an extensive search, no evidence was found for globally correlated activity related to behavior either in narrow (1.e., 35-45 Hz) or broad (i.e., 20-50 Hz) bands. Spatial patterns, extracted using principal component analysis, could not be classified with respect to stimulus type in any time interval. Instead, spatially and temporally intermittent synchronization was observed between pairs of electrodes in 1 cm X 1 cm regions with high variability within and across trials. The distribution of correlation coefficients differed substantially from background levels at inter-electrode distances of 1 cm and 1.4 cm but not 2 cm or more. The minimum duration of correlation, the decorrelation time, of the ECoG was about 50 msec; the average correlation duration at 1 cm inter-electrode distance was about 150 msec; and the recurrence rate of significant correlation peaks was about 1.3/sec. The findings suggest that the surface diameters of domains of spatially correlated activity underlying perceptual categorization in human gamma band ECoG are limited to less than 2 cm and that the intermittent synchronization observed across separations of 1 cm and 1.4 cm is not solely due to volume conduction. Thus, if such gamma band spatial patterns exist in the human brain, no existing technology would be capable of measuring them at the scalp, and subdural electrode arrays for cortical surface recording would have to have spacings under 5 mm.},

Here, we report a surprising finding of 3 narrowband gamma rhythms in V1 that processed distinct spatial frequency (SF) signals and had different neural origins. The low gamma (LG; 25 to 40 Hz) rhythm was generated at the V1 superficial layer and preferred a higher SF compared with spike activity, whereas both the medium gamma (MG; 40 to 65 Hz), generated at the cortical level, and the high gamma HG; (65 to 85 Hz), originated precortically, preferred lower SF information. Furthermore, compared with the rates of spike activity, the powers of the 3 gammas had better performance in discriminating the edge and surface of simple objects. These findings suggest that gamma rhythms reflect the neural dynamics of neural circuitries that process different SF information in the visual system, which may be crucial for multiplexing SF information and synchronizing different features of an object.},

Understanding the properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward, recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity, we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent (∼3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure (10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly at response onset. These properties and the circuit mechanism they imply provide new constraints on the functional role that correlation may play in visual processing.},

Our knowledge about neuronal correlations, however, derives largely from experiments that used different recording methods, analysis techniques, and cortical regions. Here we studied the structure of neuronal correlation in area V4 of alert macaques using recording and analysis procedures designed to match those used previously in primary visual cortex (V1), the major input to V4. We found that the spatial and temporal properties of correlations in V4 were remarkably similar to those of V1, with two notable differences: correlated variability in V4 was approximately one-third the magnitude of that in V1 and synchrony in V4 was less temporally precise than in V1. In both areas, spontaneous activity (measured during fixation while viewing a blank screen) was approximately twice as correlated as visual-evoked activity. The results provide a foundation for understanding how the structure of neuronal correlation differs among brain regions and stages in cortical processing and suggest that it is likely governed by features of neuronal circuits that are shared across the visual cortex.},

Intriguingly, different types of treatment with fairly rapid antidepressant effects (within days or a few weeks), such as ketamine, electroconvulsive therapy and non-invasive neurostimulation, seem to converge on enhancement of neural plasticity. However, the forms and mechanisms of plasticity that link antidepressant interventions to the restoration of excitatory synaptic function are still unknown. In this Review, we highlight preclinical research from the past 15 years showing that ketamine and psychedelic drugs can trigger the growth of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal neurons. We compare the longitudinal effects of various psychoactive drugs on neuronal rewiring, and we highlight rapid onset and sustained time course as notable characteristics for putative rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, we consider gaps in the current understanding of drug-evoked in vivo structural plasticity. We also discuss the prospects of using synaptic remodelling to understand other antidepressant interventions, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally, we conclude that structural neural plasticity can provide unique insights into the neurobiological actions of psychoactive drugs and antidepressant interventions.},

	abstract = {The synapse has consistently been considered a vulnerable and critical target within Alzheimer's disease, and synapse loss is, to date, one of the main biological correlates of cognitive decline within Alzheimer's disease. This occurs prior to neuronal loss with ample evidence that synaptic dysfunction precedes this, in support of the idea that synaptic failure is a crucial stage within disease pathogenesis. The two main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, abnormal aggregates of amyloid or tau proteins, have had demonstrable effects on synaptic physiology in animal and cellular models of Alzheimer's disease. There is also growing evidence that these two proteins may have a synergistic effect on neurophysiological dysfunction. Here, we review some of the main findings of synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease, and what we know from Alzheimer's disease animal and cellular models. First, we briefly summarize some of the human evidence to suggest that synapses are altered, including how this relates to network activity. Subsequently, animal and cellular models of Alzheimer's disease are considered, highlighting mouse models of amyloid and tau pathology and the role these proteins may play in synaptic dysfunction, either in isolation or examining how the two pathologies may interact in dysfunction. This specifically focuses on neurophysiological function and dysfunction observed within these animal models, typically measured using electrophysiology or calcium imaging. Following synaptic dysfunction and loss, it would be impossible to imagine that this would not alter oscillatory activity within the brain. Therefore, this review also discusses how this may underpin some of the aberrant oscillatory patterns seen in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and human patients. Finally, an overview of some key directions and considerations in the field of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is covered. This includes current therapeutics that are targeted specifically at synaptic dysfunction, but also methods that modulate activity to rescue aberrant oscillatory patterns. Other important future avenues of note in this field include the role of non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes and microglia, and mechanisms of dysfunction independent of amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease. The synapse will certainly continue to be an important target within Alzheimer's disease for the foreseeable future.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are the result of progressive dysfunction of the neuronal activity and subsequent neuronal death. Currently, the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases are by far Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) disease, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the neuropathological hallmarks for AD and Lewy bodies (LB) are the hallmark for PD, current evidence strongly suggests that oligomers seeding the neuropathological hallmarks are more toxic and disease-relevant in both pathologies. The presence of small soluble oligomers is the common bond between AD and PD: amyloid β oligomers (AβOs) and Tau oligomers (TauOs) in AD and α-synuclein oligomers (αSynOs) in PD. Such oligomers appear to be particularly increased during the early pathological stages, targeting synapses at vulnerable brain regions leading to synaptic plasticity disruption, synapse loss, inflammation, excitation to inhibition imbalance and cognitive impairment. Absence of TauOs at synapses in individuals with strong AD disease pathology but preserved cognition suggests that mechanisms of resilience may be dependent on the interactions between soluble oligomers and their synaptic targets. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge about the interactions between soluble oligomers and synaptic dysfunction in patients diagnosed with AD and PD, how it affects excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, and the potential mechanisms of synaptic resilience in humans.},

Since the discovery in 1987 that PV is expressed in a subset of fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory neurons, our knowledge of the complex molecular and physiological properties of these cells has been expanding. In this review, we highlight the specific properties of PV neurons that allow them to fire at high frequency and with high reliability, enabling them to control network oscillations and shape the encoding, consolidation and retrieval of memories. We next discuss multiple studies reporting PV neuron impairment as a critical step in neuronal network dysfunction and cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Finally, we propose potential mechanisms underlying PV neuron dysfunction in AD and we argue that early changes in PV neuron activity could be a causal step in AD-associated network and memory impairment and a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Parvalbumin expressing (PV+) GABAergic interneurons are fast spiking neurons that provide powerful but relatively short-lived inhibition to principal excitatory cells in the brain. They play a vital role in feedforward and feedback synaptic inhibition, preventing run away excitation in neural networks. Hence, their dysfunction can lead to hyperexcitability and increased susceptibility to seizures. PV+ interneurons are also key players in generating gamma oscillations, which are synchronized neural oscillations associated with various cognitive functions. PV+ interneuron are particularly vulnerable to aging and their degeneration has been associated with cognitive decline and memory impairment in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Overall, dysfunction of PV+ interneurons disrupts the normal excitatory/inhibitory balance within specific neurocircuits in the brain and thus has been linked to a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. This review focuses on the role of dysfunctional PV+ inhibitory interneurons in the generation of epileptic seizures and cognitive impairment and their potential as targets in the design of future therapeutic strategies to treat these disorders. Recent research using cutting-edge optogenetic and chemogenetic technologies has demonstrated that they can be selectively manipulated to control seizures and restore the balance of neural activity in the brains of animal models. This suggests that PV+ interneurons could be important targets in developing future treatments for patients with epilepsy and comorbid disorders, such as AD, where seizures and cognitive decline are directly linked to specific PV+ interneuron deficits.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is a largely validated neuropsychological test for the identification of amnestic syndrome from the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous electrophysiological data suggested a slowing down of the alpha rhythm in the AD-continuum as well as a key role of this rhythmic brain activity for episodic memory processes. This study therefore investigates the link between alpha brain activity and alterations in episodic memory as assessed by the FCSRT. For that purpose, 37 patients with altered FCSRT performance underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, supplemented by $^{\textrm{18}}$F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/structural magnetic resonance imaging ($^{\textrm{18}}$FDG-PET/MR), and 10 min of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). The individual alpha peak frequency (APF) in MEG resting-state data was positively correlated with patients’ encoding efficiency as well as with the efficacy of semantic cues in facilitating patients’ retrieval of previous stored word. The APF also correlated positively with patients’ hippocampal volume and their regional glucose consumption in the posterior cingulate cortex. Overall, this study demonstrates that alterations in the ability to learn and store new information for a relatively short-term period are related to a slowing down of alpha rhythmic activity, possibly due to altered interactions in the extended mnemonic system. As such, a decreased APF may be considered as an electrophysiological correlate of short-term episodic memory dysfunction accompanying pathological aging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {During slow-wave sleep and deep anesthesia, the rat hippocampus displays a slow oscillation (SO) that follows “up-and-down” state transitions in the neocortex. There has been recent debate as to whether this local field potential (LFP) rhythm reflects internal processing or entrains with respiratory inputs. To solve this issue, here we have concomitantly recorded respiration along with hippocampal, neocortical, and olfactory bulb (OB) LFPs in rats anesthetized with urethane. During the course of anesthesia, LFPs transitioned between activity states characterized by the emergence of different oscillations. By jointly analyzing multisite LFPs and respiratory cycles, we could distinguish three types of low-frequency hippocampal oscillations: (1) SO, which coupled to neocortical up-and-down transitions; (2) theta, which phase-reversed across hippocampal layers and was largest at the fissure; and (3) a low-frequency rhythm with largest amplitude in the dentate gyrus, which coupled to respiration-entrained oscillations in OB and to respiration itself. In contrast, neither theta nor SO coupled to respiration. The hippocampal respiration-coupled rhythm and SO had frequency {\textless}1.5 Hz, whereas theta tended to be faster ({\textgreater}3 Hz). Tracheotomy abolished hippocampal respiration-coupled rhythm, which was restored by rhythmic delivery of air puffs into the nasal cavity. These results solve the apparent contradictions among previous studies by demonstrating that the rat hippocampus produces multiple types of low-frequency oscillations. Because they synchronize with different brain circuits, however, we postulate that each activity pattern plays a unique role in information processing.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The rat hippocampus exhibits a large-amplitude slow oscillation ({\textless}1.5 Hz) during deep sleep and anesthesia. It is currently debated whether this rhythm reflects internal processing with the neocortex or entrainment by external inputs from rhythmic nasal respiration, which has similar frequency. Here we reconcile previous studies by showing that the hippocampus can actually produce two low-frequency rhythms at nearby frequencies: one that indeed couples to respiration and another that is coupled to the neocortex. We further show that the respiration-coupled rhythm differs from theta oscillations. The results support a role for brain oscillations in connecting distant brain regions, and posit the respiratory cycle as an important reference for neuronal communication between olfactory and memory networks.},

These models may be defined on any complex network where the variable at each node is an element of the unitary group U(n), or a subgroup of U(n). The nonlinear evolution equations maintain the unitarity of all variables which therefore evolve on the compact manifold of U(n). Synchronization of trajectories with phase locking occurs as for the Kuramoto model, for values of the coupling constant larger than a critical value, and may be measured by various order and disorder parameters. Limit cycles are characterized by a frequency matrix which is independent of the node and is determined by minimizing a function which is quadratic in the variables. We perform numerical computations for n = 2, for which the SU(2) group manifold is S3, for a range of natural frequencies and all-to-all coupling, in order to confirm synchronization properties. We also describe a second generalization of the Kuramoto model which is formulated in terms of real m-vectors confined to the (m − 1)-sphere for any positive integer m, and investigate trajectories numerically for the S2 model. This model displays a variety of synchronization phenomena in which trajectories generally synchronize spatially but are not necessarily phase-locked, even for large values of the coupling constant.},

For d = 2, the system reduces to the classic Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators; for d = 3, it has been proposed to describe the orientation dynamics of swarms of drones or other entities moving about in threedimensional space. Here, we use group theory to explain the recent discovery that the model shows low-dimensional dynamics for all N ≥ 3 and to clarify why it admits the analog of the Ott–Antonsen ansatz in the continuum limit N → ∞. The underlying reason is that the system is intimately connected to the natural hyperbolic geometry on the unit ball Bd. In this geometry, the isometries form a Lie group consisting of higher-dimensional generalizations of the Möbius transformations used in complex analysis. Once these connections are realized, the reduced dynamics and the generalized Ott–Antonsen ansatz follow immediately. This framework also reveals the seamless connection between the finite and infinite-N cases. Finally, we show that special forms of coupling yield gradient dynamics with respect to the hyperbolic metric and use that fact to obtain global stability results about convergence to the synchronized state.},

The models proposed by Winfree and Kuramoto stand as the classic frameworks for investigating these phenomena. The Kuramoto model, in particular, has been extended in different ways since its original formulation to account for more general scenarios. One such extension replaces the coupling parameter with a coupling matrix, describing a form of generalized frustration with broken rotational symmetry. A key feature of this model is the existence of \{{\textbackslash}it phase tuned states\}, characterized by having the phase of the order parameter pointing in the direction of the dominant eigenvector of the coupling matrix. Here we investigate the matrix coupled Kuramoto model on networks with two modules, such that one module is in the phase tuned state and the other in a state where the order parameter rotates. We identified different regimes in which one or the other module dominates the dynamics. We found, in particular, that the phase tuned module can create a bottleneck for the oscillation of the rotating module, leading to a behavior similar to the charge and fire regimes of excitable systems. We also found an extended region in the parameter space where motion is globally disordered, even though one of the modules presented high levels of synchronization when uncoupled.},

	abstract = {The Kuramoto model, originally proposed to model the dynamics of many interacting oscillators, has been used and generalized for a wide range of applications involving the collective behavior of large heterogeneous groups of dynamical units whose states are characterized by a scalar angle variable. One such application in which we are interested is the alignment of orientation vectors among members of a swarm. Despite being commonly used for this purpose, the Kuramoto model can only describe swarms in two dimensions, and hence the results obtained do not apply to the often relevant situation of swarms in three dimensions. Partly based on this motivation, as well as on relevance to the classical, mean-field, zero-temperature Heisenberg model with quenched site disorder, in this paper we study the Kuramoto model generalized to 𝐷 dimensions. We show that in the important case of three dimensions, as well as for any odd number of dimensions, the 𝐷-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model for heterogeneous units has dynamics that are remarkably different from the dynamics in two dimensions. In particular, for odd 𝐷 the transition to coherence occurs discontinuously as the interunit coupling constant 𝐾 is increased through zero, as opposed to the 𝐷 =2 case (and, as we show, also the case of even 𝐷) for which the transition to coherence occurs continuously as 𝐾 increases through a positive critical value 𝐾𝑐. We also demonstrate the qualitative applicability of our results to related models constructed specifically to capture swarming and flocking dynamics in three dimensions.},

In this paper, for the high-dimensional Kuramoto model of identical oscillators, a matrix Riccati differential equation (MRDE) is proposed to describe the error dynamics. Based on the MRDE, the exponential synchronization is proved by constructing a total error function for the case of digraphs admitting spanning trees. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to illustrate the obtained theoretical results.},

	abstract = {For any network topology, we investigate a complex variant of the Kuramoto model, whose real part formally reduces to the original Kuramoto model for coupled oscillators when the coupling strength κ is imaginary. The major attraction of the complex variant lies in its exact solution, because it obeys a linear set of diﬀerential equations. The entire spectrum (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) can be deduced from a generalized Laplacian. We show that the formal resemblence to the original Kuramoto model is deceptive and that forcing the complex variant to coincide with the original one, leads to inconsistencies. Moreover, the complex variant is unstable for most graphs (except for trees) when κ is imaginary. The positive news is that the linear complex variant for real κ is expected to be close “on average” to the repulsive, non-linear cosine-variant of the Kuramoto model.},

	abstract = {Synchronization of an ensemble of oscillators is an emergent phenomenon present in several complex systems, ranging from social and physical to biological and technological systems. The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.},

We use the bifurcation analysis of these equations to study the transition from the asynchronous to synchronous state. We demonstrate that the form of the frequency distribution may play a substantial role in synchronization. In particular, for Lorentzian distribution the delay prevents synchronization, while for other distributions the delay can facilitate synchronization.},

However, populations of neurons can also exhibit transient bursts of spiking activity, wherein neurons fire in a specific temporal order or sequence6–8. The human brain may utilize these neuronal sequences within population bursts to efficiently represent information9–12, thereby complementing the well-known neural code based on spike rate or latency. Here we examined this possibility by recording the spiking activity of populations of single units in the human anterior temporal lobe as eight participants performed a visual categorization task. We find that population spiking activity organizes into bursts during the task. The temporal order of spiking across the activated units within each burst varies across stimulus categories, creating unique stereotypical sequences for individual categories as well as for individual exemplars within a category. The information conveyed by the temporal order of spiking activity is separable from and complements the information conveyed by the units’ spike rates or latencies following stimulus onset. Collectively, our data provide evidence that the human brain contains a complementary code based on the neuronal sequence within bursts of population spiking to represent information.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment and large loss of grey matter volume and is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the stage that precedes the AD dementia stage, but individuals with MCI do not always convert to the AD dementia stage, and it remains unclear why.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess grey matter loss across the brain at different stages of the clinical continuum of AD to gain a better understanding of disease progression.
METHODS: In this large-cohort study (N = 1,386) using neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, voxel-based morphometry analyses were performed between healthy controls, individuals with early and late and AD dementia stage.
RESULTS: Clear patterns of grey matter loss in mostly hippocampal and temporal regions were found across clinical stages, though not yet in early MCI. In contrast, thalamic volume loss seems one of the first signs of cognitive decline already during early MCI, whereas this volume loss does not further progress from late MCI to AD dementia stage. AD dementia stage converters already show grey matter loss in hippocampal and mid-temporal areas as well as the posterior thalamus (pulvinar) and angular gyrus at baseline.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the role of temporal brain regions in AD development and suggests additional involvement of the thalamus/pulvinar and angular gyrus that may be linked to visuospatial, attentional, and memory related problems in both early MCI and AD dementia stage conversion.},

Although gray matter volumetric abnormalities are commonly detected in patients with mild cognition impairment (MCI) and patients with AD, the gray matter surface-based deterioration pattern associated with the progression of the disease from MCI to AD stages is largely unknown. To identify group differences in gray matter surface morphometry, including cortical thickness, the gyrification index (GI), and the sulcus depth, 80 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were split into healthy controls (HCs; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20), early MCIs (EMCI; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20), late MCIs (LMCI; {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20), and ADs ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20). Regions-of-interest (ROI)-based surface morphometry was subsequently studied and compared across the four stage groups to characterize the gray matter deterioration during AD progression. Co-alteration patterns (Spearman's correlation coefficient) across the whole brain were also examined. Results showed that patients with MCI and AD exhibited a significant reduction in cortical thickness ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001) mainly in the cingulate region (four subregions) and in the temporal (thirteen subregions), parietal (five subregions), and frontal (six subregions) lobes compared to HCs. The sulcus depth of the eight temporal, four frontal, four occipital, and eight parietal subregions were also significantly affected ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001) by the progression of AD. The GI was shown to be insensitive to AD progression (only three subregions were detected with a significant difference, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}p{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.001). Moreover, Spearman's correlation analysis confirmed that the co-alteration pattern of the cortical thickness and sulcus depth indices is predominant during AD progression. The findings highlight the relevance between gray matter surface morphometry and the stages of AD, laying the foundation for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} tracking of AD progression.

Given the large numbers of people affected by AD, there is a need for a low-cost, easy to use method to detect AD patients. Potentially, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a valuable role in this, but at present no single EEG biomarker is robust enough for use in practice. This study aims to provide a methodological framework for the development of robust EEG biomarkers to detect AD with a clinically acceptable performance by exploiting the combined strengths of key biomarkers. A large number of existing and novel EEG biomarkers associated with slowing of EEG, reduction in EEG complexity and decrease in EEG connectivity were investigated. Support vector machine and linear discriminate analysis methods were used to find the best combination of the EEG biomarkers to detect AD with significant performance. A total of 325,567 EEG biomarkers were investigated, and a panel of six biomarkers was identified and used to create a diagnostic model with high performance (≥85\% for sensitivity and 100\% for specificity).},

Prefrontal and insular cortices display non-selective neural populations to rewards and punishments. Non-selective responses, however, give rise to context-specific interareal interactions. We identify a reward subsystem with redundant interactions between the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, with a driving role of the latter. In addition, we find a punishment subsystem with redundant interactions between the insular and dorsolateral cortices, with a driving role of the insula. Finally, switching between reward and punishment learning is mediated by synergistic interactions between the two subsystems.

By clustering transient states of functional connectivity, we demonstrated that brain activity during unconsciousness is dominated by a recurrent pattern primarily mediated by structural connectivity and with a reduced capacity to transition to other patterns. Our results provide evidence supporting the pronounced differences between conscious and unconscious brain states in terms of whole-brain dynamics; in particular, the maintenance of rich brain dynamics measured by entropy is a critical aspect of conscious awareness. Collectively, our results may have significant implications for our understanding of consciousness and the neural basis of human awareness, as well as for the discovery of robust signatures of consciousness that are generalizable among different brain conditions.},

	abstract = {The neurophysiological mechanisms supporting brain maturation are fundamental to attention and memory capacity across the lifespan. Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (i.e., attention to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93 – 54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance with steeper slopes indexing inhibition and flatter slopes indexing excitation. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in gray matter volume are differentially associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC inhibitory control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.},

	abstract = {Sentence comprehension involves the rapid decoding of both semantic and grammatical information, a process fundamental to communication. As with other complex cognitive processes, language comprehension relies, in part, on long-term memory. However, the electrophysiological mechanisms underpinning the initial encoding and generalisation of higher-order linguistic knowledge remain elusive, particularly from a sleep-based consolidation perspective. One candidate mechanism that may support the consolidation of higher-order language is the temporal coordination of slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). To examine this hypothesis, we analysed electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from 35 participants (Mage = 25.4, SD = 7.10; 16 males) during an artificial language learning task, contrasting performance between individuals who were given an 8hr nocturnal sleep period or an equivalent period of wake. We found that sleep relative to wake was associated with superior performance for rules that followed a sequence-based word order. Post-sleep sequence-based word order processing was further associated with less task-related theta desynchronisation, an electrophysiological signature of successful memory consolidation, as well as cognitive control and working memory. Frontal NREM SO-spindle coupling was also positively associated with behavioural sensitivity to sequence-based word order rules, as well as with task-related theta power. As such, theta activity during retrieval of previously learned information correlates with SO-spindle coupling, thus linking neural activity in the sleeping and waking brain. Taken together, this study presents converging behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for a role of NREM SO-spindle coupling and task-related theta activity as signatures of successful memory consolidation and retrieval in the context of higher-order language learning.
Significance statement The endogenous temporal coordination of neural oscillations supports information processing during both wake and sleep states. Here we demonstrate that slow oscillation-spindle coupling during non-rapid eye movement sleep predicts the consolidation of complex grammatical rules and modulates task-related oscillatory dynamics previously implicated in sentence processing. We show that increases in theta power predict enhanced sensitivity to grammatical violations after a period of sleep and strong slow oscillation-spindle coupling modulates subsequent task-related theta activity to influence behaviour. Our findings reveal a complex interaction between both wake- and sleep-related oscillatory dynamics during the early stages of language learning beyond the single word level.},

RNN units are commonly modeled using various nonlinear activation functions, assuming these architectural differences do not affect emerging task solutions. Contrary to this view, we show that single-unit activation functions confer inductive biases that influence the geometry of neural population trajectories, single-unit selectivity, and fixed point configurations. Using a model distillation approach, we find that differences in neural representations and dynamics reflect qualitatively distinct circuit solutions to cognitive tasks emerging in RNNs with different activation functions, leading to disparate generalization behavior on out-of-distribution inputs. Our results show that seemingly minor architectural differences provide strong inductive biases for task solutions, raising a question about which RNN architectures better align with mechanisms of task execution in biological networks.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have varying responses to AD drugs and there may be no single treatment for all AD patients. Trial after trial shows that identifying non-responsive and responsive subgroups and their corresponding moderators will provide better insights into subject selection and interpretation in future clinical trials. We aim to extensively investigate pre-treatment features that moderate treatment effect of Galantamine, Bapineuzumab, and Semagacestat from completed trial data. We obtained individual-level patient data from ten randomized clinical trials. Six Galantamine trials and two Bapineuzumab trials were from Yale University Open Data Access Project and two Semagacestat trials were from the Center for Global Clinical Research Data. We included a total of 10,948 subjects. The trials were conducted worldwide from 2001 to 2012. We estimated treatment effect using causal forest modeling on each trial. Finally, we identified important pre-treatment features that determine treatment efficacy and identified responsive or nonresponsive subgroups. As a result, patient's pre-treatment conditions that determined the treatment efficacy of Galantamine differed by dementia stages, but we consistently observed that non-responders in Galantamine trials had lower BMI (25 vs 28, P {\textless} .001) and increased ages (74 vs 68, P {\textless} .001). Responders in Bapineuzumab and Semagacestat trials had lower Aβ42 levels (6.41 vs 6.53 pg/ml, P {\textless} .001) and smaller whole brain volumes (983.13 vs 1052.78 ml, P {\textless} .001). 6 'positive' treatment trials had subsets of patients who had, in fact, not responded. 4 "negative" treatment trials had subsets of patients who had, in fact, responded. This study suggests that analyzing heterogeneity in treatment effects in "positive" or "negative" trials may be a very powerful tool for identifying distinct subgroups that are responsive to treatments, which may significantly benefit future clinical trial design and interpretation.},

Voltages were simulated on all four heads for perturbations of different magnitude, haemorrhage and ischaemia, in five different positions and for three levels of instrumentation noise. Statistical analysis showed that reconstructions on the correct mesh were on average 25\% better than on the other meshes. However, the stroke detection rates were not improved. We conclude that a generic head mesh is sufficient for monitoring patients for secondary strokes following head trauma.},

To evaluate both instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms, experiments are first performed in head tanks. Existing methods, whilst accurate, produce a discontinuous conductivity, and are often made by hand, making it hard for other researchers to replicate. Approach. We have developed a method for constructing head tanks directly in a 3D printer. Conductivity was controlled through perforations in the skull surface, which allow for saline to pass through. Varying the diameter of the holes allowed for the conductivity to be controlled with 3\% error for the target conductivity range. Taking CT and MRI segmentations as a basis, this method was employed to create an adult tank with a continuous conductivity distribution, and a neonatal tank with fontanelles. Main results. Using 3D scanning a geometric accuracy of 0.21 mm was recorded, equal to that of the precision of the 3D printer used. Differences of 6.1\% ± 6.4\% (n = 11 in 4 tanks) compared to simulations were recorded in c. 800 boundary voltages. This may be attributed to the morphology of the skulls increasing tortuosity effects and hole misalignment. Despite significant differences in errors between three repetitions of the neonatal tank, images of a realistic perturbation could still be reconstructed with different tanks used for the baseline and perturbation datasets. Significance. These phantoms can be reproduced by any researcher with access to a ‘hobbyist’ 3D printer in a matter of days.

Eleven first-episode stroke patients were scanned five times during a period of 6 months, and 11 healthy control subjects were scanned three times within 1 month. In patients with right pontine strokes, the functional connectivity between the right motor cortex and the left cerebellum was selectively reduced. This connectivity pattern was reversed in patients with left pontine strokes. Although factors beyond anatomical connectivity contribute to fMRI measures of functional correlation, these results provide direct evidence that functional connectivity depends on intact connections within a specific polysynaptic pathway.},

	abstract = {Early biomarkers are needed to identify individuals at high risk of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease and to better understand the pathophysiological processes of disease progression. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease EEG changes would be non-invasive and cheap screening tools and could also help to predict future progression to clinical Alzheimer’s disease. However, the impact of amyloid-β deposition and neurodegeneration on EEG biomarkers needs to be elucidated. We included participants from the INSIGHT-preAD cohort, which is an ongoing single-centre multimodal observational study that was designed to identify risk factors and markers of progression to clinical Alzheimer’s disease in 318 cognitively normal individuals aged 70–85 years with a subjective memory complaint. We divided the subjects into four groups, according to their amyloid status (based on 18F-florbetapir PET) and neurodegeneration status (evidenced by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET brain metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease signature regions). The first group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to stage 2 of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. The second group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-negative, which corresponds to stage 1 of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. The third group was amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to ‘suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathophysiology’. The last group was the control group, defined by amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-negative subjects. We analysed 314 baseline 256-channel high-density eyes closed 1-min resting state EEG recordings. EEG biomarkers included spectral measures, algorithmic complexity and functional connectivity assessed with a novel information-theoretic measure, weighted symbolic mutual information. The most prominent effects of neurodegeneration on EEG metrics were localized in frontocentral regions with an increase in high frequency oscillations (higher beta and gamma power) and a decrease in low frequency oscillations (lower delta power), higher spectral entropy, higher complexity and increased functional connectivity measured by weighted symbolic mutual information in theta band. Neurodegeneration was associated with a widespread increase of median spectral frequency. We found a non-linear relationship between amyloid burden and EEG metrics in neurodegeneration-positive subjects, either following a U-shape curve for delta power or an inverted U-shape curve for the other metrics, meaning that EEG patterns are modulated differently depending on the degree of amyloid burden. This finding suggests initial compensatory mechanisms that are overwhelmed for the highest amyloid load. Together, these results indicate that EEG metrics are useful biomarkers for the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease.},

We tested whether cortical “resonance,” favorable stimulation frequencies at which the sensory cortices respond maximally, influenced the impact of FDP on perception, functional topography, and connectivity of the primary somatosensory cortex using psychophysics and functional imaging (fMRI). We costimulated two digits on the hand synchronously at, above, or below the resonance frequency of the somatosensory cortex, and tested subjects’ accuracy and speed on tactile localization before and after costimulation. More errors and slower response times followed costimulation at above- or below-resonance, respectively. Response times were faster after at-resonance costimulation. In the fMRI, the cortical representations of the two digits costimulated above-resonance shifted closer, potentially accounting for the poorer performance. Costimulation at-resonance did not shift the digit regions, but increased the functional coupling between them, potentially accounting for the improved response time. To relate these results to synaptic plasticity, we simulated a network of oscillators incorporating Hebbian learning. Two neighboring patches embedded in a cortical sheet, mimicking the two digit regions, were costimulated at different frequencies. Network activation outside the stimulated patches was greatest at above-resonance frequencies, reproducing the spread of digit representations seen with fMRI. Connection strengths within the patches increased following at-resonance costimulation, reproducing the increased fMRI connectivity. We show that FDP extends to the cortical level and is influenced by cortical resonance.},

Despite their widespread use since the 1950s and 1960s, the ‘downstream’ mechanism by which antidepressants ultimately exert their therapeutic effects remains elusive. In addition, except for a few exceptions such as episode severity and the presence of comorbid Axis-I or Axis-III disorders, biological or clinical characteristics which can accurately quantify the risk of poor treatment outcome are lacking, as are factors which could help patients and clinicians select treatment options that would result in superior outcome. The identification of such markers, termed ‘surrogate’ markers, could help shed further insights into what constitutes illness and recovery, help identify molecular targets for the development of future antidepressants, and lead the way to the design and refinement of a personalized medicine treatment model for MDD. In the following text, several major areas (‘leads’) where evidence exists regarding the presence of surrogate markers of efficacy outcome in MDD will be briefly reviewed. Leads include evidence from the role of demographic and clinical factors as surrogate markers, to the role of various biological markers including genotype, brain functional imaging, electroencephalography, dichotic listening, and molecular biology and immunology. The purpose of this work is to focus selectively on areas where there have been findings, as opposed to conducting an exhaustive literature review of studies which have failed to yield any significant breakthrough in our knowledge.},

The developmental origin of this diversity is currently unclear, as representations could arise through processes that are already area-specific from the earliest developmental stages or alternatively, they could emerge from an initially common functional organization shared across areas. Here, we use spontaneous activity recorded with two-photon and widefield calcium imaging to reveal the functional organization across the early developing cortex in ferrets, a species with a well-characterized columnar organization and modular structure of spontaneous activity in the visual cortex. We find that in animals 7 to 14 d prior to eye-opening and ear canal opening, spontaneous activity in both sensory areas (auditory and somatosensory cortex, A1 and S1, respectively), and association areas (posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex, PPC and PFC, respectively) showed an organized and modular structure that is highly similar to the organization in V1. In all cortical areas, this modular activity was distributed across the cortical surface, forming functional networks that exhibit millimeter-scale correlations. Moreover, this modular structure was evident in highly coherent spontaneous activity at the cellular level, with strong correlations among local populations of neurons apparent in all cortical areas examined. Together, our results demonstrate a common distributed and modular organization across the cortex during early development, suggesting that diverse cortical representations develop initially according to similar design principles.},

	abstract = {Neural oscillations in distinct frequency bands are ubiquitous in the brain and play a role in many cognitive processes. The "communication by coherence" hypothesis, poses that the synchronization through phase coupling of frequency-specific neural oscillations regulate information flow across distribute brain regions. Specifically, the posterior alpha frequency band (7-12 Hz) is thought to gate bottom-up visual information flow by inhibition during visual processing. Evidence shows that increased alpha phase coherency positively correlates with functional connectivity in resting state connectivity networks, supporting alpha mediates neural communication through coherency. However, these findings have mainly been derived from spontaneous changes in the ongoing alpha rhythm. In this study, we experimentally modulate the alpha rhythm by targeting individuals' intrinsic alpha frequency with sustained rhythmic light to investigate alpha-mediated synchronous cortical activity in both EEG and fMRI. We hypothesize increased alpha coherency and fMRI connectivity should arise from modulation of the intrinsic alpha frequency (IAF) as opposed to control frequencies in the alpha range. Sustained rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation at the IAF and at neighboring frequencies within the alpha band range (7-12 Hz) was implemented and assessed in a separate EEG and fMRI study. We observed increased cortical alpha phase coherency in the visual cortex during rhythmic stimulation at the IAF as in comparison to rhythmic stimulation of control frequencies. In the fMRI, we found increased functional connectivity for stimulation at the IAF in visual and parietal areas as compared to other rhythmic control frequencies by correlating time courses from a set of regions of interest for the different stimulation conditions and applying network-based statistics. This suggests that rhythmic stimulation at the IAF frequency induces a higher degree of synchronicity of neural activity across the occipital and parietal cortex, which supports the role of the alpha oscillation in gating information flow during visual processing.},

Inter-subject variations in the electric fields may help to explain the variability in the effects of tDCS. Here, we use multiple-subject analysis to study the strength and variability of the group-level electric fields in the standard brain space. Personalized anatomically-accurate models of 62 subjects were constructed from T1- and T2-weighted MRI. The finite-element method was used to computationally estimate the individual electric fields, which were registered to the standard space using surface based registration. Motor cortical and frontal tDCS were modelled for 16 electrode montages. For each electrode montage, the group-level electric fields had a consistent strength and direction in several brain regions, which could also be located at some distance from the electrodes. In other regions, the electric fields were more variable, and thus more likely to produce variable effects in each individual. Both the anode and cathode locations affected the group-level electric fields, both directly under the electrodes and elsewhere. For motor cortical tDCS, the electric fields could be controlled at the group level by moving the electrodes. However, for frontal tDCS, the group-level electric fields were more variable, and the electrode locations had only minor effects on the group average fields. Our results reveal the electric fields and their variability at the group level in the standard brain space, providing insights into the mechanisms of tDCS for plasticity induction.

	abstract = {The dose-response characteristics of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain uncertain but may be related to variability in brain electric fields due to individual anatomical factors. Here, we investigated whether the electric fields influence the responses to motor cortical tDCS. In a randomized cross-over design, 21 participants underwent 10 min of anodal tDCS with 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mA or sham. Compared to sham, all active conditions increased the size of motor evoked potentials (MEP) normalized to the pre-tDCS baseline, irrespective of anterior or posterior magnetic test stimuli. The electric field calculated in the motor cortex of each participant had a nonlinear effect on the normalized MEP size, but its effects were small compared to those of other participant-specific factors. The findings support the efficacy of anodal tDCS in enhancing the MEP size but do not demonstrate any benefits of personalized electric field modeling in explaining tDCS response variability.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes a complex spatial distribution of the electric current flow in the head which hampers the accurate localization of the stimulated brain areas. In this study we show how various anatomical features systematically shape the electric field distribution in the brain during tDCS. We constructed anatomically realistic finite element (FEM) models of two individual heads including conductivity anisotropy and different skull layers. We simulated a widely employed electrode montage to induce motor cortex plasticity and moved the stimulating electrode over the motor cortex in small steps to examine the resulting changes of the electric field distribution in the underlying cortex. We examined the effect of skull thickness and composition on the passing currents showing that thinner skull regions lead to higher electric field strengths. This effect is counteracted by a larger proportion of higher conducting spongy bone in thicker regions leading to a more homogenous current over the skull. Using a multiple regression model we could identify key factors that determine the field distribution to a significant extent, namely the thicknesses of the cerebrospinal fluid and the skull, the gyral depth and the distance to the anode and cathode. These factors account for up to 50\% of the spatial variation of the electric field strength. Further, we demonstrate that individual anatomical factors can lead to stimulation "hotspots" which are partly resistant to electrode positioning. Our results give valuable novel insights in the biophysical foundation of tDCS and highlight the importance to account for individual anatomical factors when choosing an electrode montage.},

Modulation of synchronous low-frequency, but not high-frequency, activity in parietal cortex preferentially improved working memory on day 3 and day 4 and 1 month after intervention, whereas modulation of synchronous high-frequency, but not low-frequency, activity in prefrontal cortex preferentially improved long-term memory on days 2–4 and 1 month after intervention. The rate of memory improvements over 4 days predicted the size of memory benefits 1 month later. Individuals with lower baseline cognitive function experienced larger, more enduring memory improvements.

	abstract = {Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has attracted interest as a technique for causal investigations into how rhythmic fluctuations in brain neural activity influence cognition and for promoting cognitive rehabilitation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of tACS on cognitive function across 102 published studies, which included 2893 individuals in healthy, aging, and neuropsychiatric populations. A total of 304 effects were extracted from these 102 studies. We found modest to moderate improvements in cognitive function with tACS treatment that were evident in several cognitive domains, including working memory, long-term memory, attention, executive control, and fluid intelligence. Improvements in cognitive function were generally stronger after completion of tACS ("offline" effects) than during tACS treatment ("online" effects). Improvements in cognitive function were greater in studies that used current flow models to optimize or confirm neuromodulation targets by stimulating electric fields generated in the brain by tACS protocols. In studies targeting multiple brain regions concurrently, cognitive function changed bidirectionally (improved or decreased) according to the relative phase, or alignment, of the alternating current in the two brain regions (in phase versus antiphase). We also noted improvements in cognitive function separately in older adults and in individuals with neuropsychiatric illnesses. Overall, our findings contribute to the debate surrounding the effectiveness of tACS for cognitive rehabilitation, quantitatively demonstrate its potential, and indicate further directions for optimal tACS clinical study design.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess whether exposure to non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at γ frequency (γ-tACS) applied over Pz (an area overlying the medial parietal cortex and the precuneus) can improve memory and modulate cholinergic transmission in mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD).
METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover pilot study, participants were assigned to a single 60 min treatment with exposure to γ-tACS over Pz or sham tACS. Each subject underwent a clinical evaluation including assessment of episodic memory pre- and post-γ-tACS or sham stimulation. Indirect measures of cholinergic transmission evaluated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pre- and post-γ-tACS or sham tACS were evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty MCI-AD participants completed the study. No tACS-related side effects were observed, and the intervention was well tolerated in all participants. We observed a significant improvement at the Rey auditory verbal learning (RAVL) test total recall (5.7 [95\% CI, 4.0 to 7.4], p {\textless} 0.001) and long delayed recall scores (1.3 [95\% CI, 0.4 to 2.1], p = 0.007) after γ-tACS but not after sham tACS.

Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission evaluated with TMS, increased only after γ-tACS (0.31 [95\% CI, 0.24 to 0.38], p {\textless} 0.001) but not after sham tACS.
CONCLUSIONS: exposure to γ-tACS over Pz showed a significant improvement of memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical connectivity measures of cholinergic neurotransmission, compared to sham tACS.},

In the present paper, we describe the rationale and design of a study assessing safety, feasibility, clinical and biological efficacy, and predictors of outcome of a home-based intervention consisting of γ-tACS over the precuneus.
METHODS: In a first phase, 60 AD patients will be randomized into two arms: ARM1, 8-week precuneus γ-tACS (frequency: 40 Hz, intensity: 2 mA, duration: 5 60-min sessions/week); and ARM2, 8-week sham tACS (same parameters as the real γ-tACS, with the current being discontinued 5 s after the beginning of the stimulation). In a second phase, all participants will receive 8-week γ-tACS (same parameters as the real γ-tACS in the first phase). The study outcomes will be collected at several timepoints throughout the study duration and include information on safety and feasibility, neuropsychological assessment, blood sampling, electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation neurotransmitter measures, and magnetic resonance imaging or amyloid positron emission tomography.
RESULTS: We expect that this intervention is safe and feasible and results in the improvement of cognition, entrainment of gamma oscillations, increased functional connectivity, reduction of pathological burden, and increased cholinergic transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: If our expected results are achieved, home-based interventions using γ-tACS, either alone or in combination with other therapies, may become a reality for treating AD.

	abstract = {The term neuroplasticity encompasses structural and functional modifications of neuronal connectivity. Abnormal neuroplasticity is involved in various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dystonia, epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal degeneration, schizophrenia, and post cerebral stroke. Drugs affecting neuroplasticity are increasingly used as therapeutics in these conditions. Neuroplasticity was first discovered and explored in animal experimentation. However, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has enabled researchers recently to induce and study similar processes in the intact human brain. Plasticity induced by NIBS can be modulated by pharmacological interventions, targeting ion channels, or neurotransmitters. Importantly, abnormalities of plasticity as studied by NIBS are directly related to clinical symptoms in neuropsychiatric diseases. Therefore, a core theme of this review is the hypothesis that NIBS-induced plasticity can explore and potentially predict the therapeutic efficacy of CNS-acting drugs in neuropsychiatric diseases. We will (a) review the basics of neuroplasticity, as explored in animal experimentation, and relate these to our knowledge about neuroplasticity induced in humans by NIBS techniques. We will then (b) discuss pharmacological modulation of plasticity in animals and humans. Finally, we will (c) review abnormalities of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, and discuss how the combination of NIBS with pharmacological intervention may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of abnormal plasticity in these diseases and their purposeful pharmacological treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The main manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients and animal models is impaired memory function, characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and impairment of gamma oscillations that play an important role in perception and cognitive function. The therapeutic effect of gamma band stimulation in AD mouse models has been reported recently. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is an emerging non-invasive intervention method, but at present, researchers have not completely understood the intervention effect of tACS. Thus, the intervention mechanism of tACS has not been fully elucidated, and the course of treatment in clinical selection also lacks theoretical support. Based on this issue, we investigated the effect of gamma frequency (40 Hz) tACS at different durations in a mouse model of AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We placed stimulating electrodes on the skull surface of APP/PS1 and wild-type control mice (n = 30 and n = 5, respectively). Among them, 20 APP/PS1 mice were divided into 4 groups to receive 20 min 40 Hz tACS every day for 1-4 weeks. The other 10 APP/PS1 mice were equally divided into two groups to receive sham treatment and no treatment. No intervention was performed in the wild-type control mice. The short-term memory function of the mice was examined by the Y maze. Aβ levels and microglia in the hippocampus were measured by immunofluorescence. Spontaneous electroencephalogram gamma power was calculated by the average period method, and brain connectivity was examined by cross-frequency coupling.
RESULTS: We found that the long-term treatment groups (21 and 28 days) had decreased hippocampal Aβ levels, increased electroencephalogram spontaneous gamma power, and ultimately improved short-term memory function. The treatment effect of the short-term treatment group (7 days) was not significant. Moreover, the treatment effect of the 14-day treatment group was weaker than that of the 21-day treatment group.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that long-term gamma-frequency tACS is more effective in treating AD by reducing Aβ load and improving gamma oscillation than short-term gamma-frequency tACS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain stimulation interventions are increasingly used to reduce craving and consumption in individuals with drug addiction or excessive eating behavior. However, the efficacy of these novel treatments and whether effect sizes are affected by the length of the intervention has not been comprehensively evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: A meta-analytical approach was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of non-invasive excitatory brain stimulation [transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and high-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)] targeted at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for reducing craving and consumption levels in drug and eating addiction, including both single- and multi-session protocols.
METHODS: After a comprehensive literature search, 48 peer-reviewed studies (1095 participants in total) were included in the current meta-analysis. We computed Hedge's g as a conservative measure for evaluating effect sizes.
RESULTS: Random effects analyses revealed a small effect of neuromodulation interventions on craving and a medium effect on consumption, favoring active over sham stimulation. These effects did not differ across the different populations investigated (alcohol, nicotine, illicit drugs, eating addictions) or by the used technique (rTMS/tDCS, left/right hemisphere). Multi-session protocols showed a larger effect size for reducing craving and consumption than single-session protocols, with a positive linear association between the number of sessions or administered pulses and craving reduction, indicating a dose-response effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide compelling evidence that novel non-invasive brain stimulation targeted at dlPFC reduces craving and consumption levels (providing the first meta-analytical evidence for the latter effect in drug addiction), with larger effects in multi-session as compared to single-session interventions.},

RESULTS: Compared to sham tDCS, active tDCS improved global cognition measured with Mini-Mental State Examination (p for interaction = 0.02) and language function assessed by Boston Naming Test (p for interaction = 0.04), but not delayed recall performance. In addition, active tDCS prevented decreases in executive function at a marginal level (p for interaction {\textless} 0.10). rCMRglc in the left middle/inferior temporal gyrus was preserved in the active group, but decreased in the sham group (p for interaction {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Daily tDCS over the DLPFC for 6 months may improve or stabilize cognition and rCMRglc in AD patients, suggesting the therapeutic potential of repeated at-home tDCS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has been administered over single brain regions for small numbers of sessions. Safety, feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS over multiple brain regions, multiple daily stimulations and long periods are not established.
OBJECTIVE: We studied safety, feasibility and tolerability of daily HD-tDCS over 2-4 brain regions for 20 sessions in healthy adults.
METHODS: Five healthy adults underwent physical and neurological examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and cognitive screening (ImpACT) before, during and after HD-tDCS. Four networks (left/right temporoparietal and frontal) were stimulated in sequence (20 min each) using HD-tDCS in 20 daily sessions. Sessions 1-10 included sequential stimulation of both temporoparietal networks, sessions 11-15 stimulations of 4 networks and sessions 16-20 two daily stimulation cycles of 4 networks/cycle (1.5 mA/network). Side effects, ImpACT scores and EEG power spectrum were compared before and after HD-tDCS.
RESULTS: All subjects completed the trial. Adverse events were tingling, transient redness at the stimulation site, perception of continuing stimulation after end of session and one self-resolving headache. EEG power spectrum showed decreased delta power in frontal areas several days after HD-tDCS. While at the group level ImpACT scores did not differ before and after stimulations, we found a trend for correlation between decreased EEG delta power and individual improvements in ImpACT scores after HD-tDCS.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged, repeat daily stimulation of multiple brain regions using HD-tDCS is feasible and safe in healthy adults. Preliminary EEG results suggest that HD-tDCS may induce long lasting changes in excitability in the brain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The safety and tolerability of limited output transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) in clinical populations support a non-significant risk designation. The tolerability of long-term use in a healthy population had remained untested.
OBJECTIVE: We tested the tolerability and compliance of two tES waveforms, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and modulated high frequency transcranial pulsed current stimulation (MHF-tPCS) compared to sham-tDCS, applied to healthy subjects for three to five days (17-20 minutes per day) per week for up to six weeks in a communal setting. MHF-tPCS consisted of asymmetric high-frequency pulses (7-11 kHz) having a peak amplitude of 10-20 mA peak, adjusted by subject, resulting in an average current of 5-7 mA.
METHOD: A total of 100 treatment blind healthy subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: tDCS (n = 33), MHF-tPCS (n = 30), or sham-tDCS (n = 37). In order to test the role of waveform, electrode type and montage were fixed across tES and sham-tDCS arms: high-capacity self-adhering electrodes on the right lateral forehead and back of the neck. We conducted 1905 sessions (636 sham-tDCS, 623 tDCS, and 646 MHF-tPCS sessions) on study volunteers over a period of six weeks.
RESULTS: Common adverse events were primarily restricted to influences upon the skin and included skin tingling, itching, and mild burning sensations. The incidence of these events in the active tES treatment arms (MHF-tPCS, tDCS) was equivalent or significantly lower than their incidence in the sham-tDCS treatment arm. Other adverse events had a rarity ({\textless}5\% incidence) that could not be significantly distinguished across the treatment groups. Some subjects were withdrawn from the study due to atypical headache (sham-tDCS n = 2, tDCS n = 2, and MHF-tPCS n = 3), atypical discomfort (sham-tDCS n = 0, tDCS n = 1, and MHF-tPCS n = 1), or atypical skin irritation (sham-tDCS n = 2, tDCS n = 8, and MHF-tPCS n = 1). The rate of compliance, elected sessions completed, for the MHF-tPCS group was significantly greater than the sham-tDCS group's compliance (p = 0.007). There were no serious adverse events in any treatment condition.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that repeated application of limited output tES across extended periods, limited to the hardware, electrodes, and protocols tested here, is well tolerated in healthy subjects, as previously observed in clinical populations.},

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), a method that can selectively inhibit or excitate neuronal populations by modulating GABAergic (anodal stimulation) and glutamatergic (cathodal stimulation) activity [5, 6]. We trained subjects for 6 days with artificial numerical symbols, during which we applied concurrent TDCS to the parietal lobes. The polarity of the brain stimulation specifically enhanced or impaired the acquisition of automatic number processing and the mapping of number into space, both important indices of numerical proficiency [7-9]. The improvement was still present 6 months after the training. Control tasks revealed that the effect of brain stimulation was specific to the representation of artificial numerical symbols. The specificity and longevity of TDCS on numerical abilities establishes TDCS as a realistic tool for intervention in cases of atypical numerical development or loss of numerical abilities because of stroke or degenerative illnesses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repeated sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are increasingly used for therapeutic applications. However, adverse events (AEs) associated with repeated sessions have not been comprehensively evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the safety of repeated sessions of tDCS, examining AE risk relative to tDCS exposure. Further, to identify whether certain participant populations are particularly at risk from tDCS.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis included sham-controlled studies (up to June 2017) involving two or more tDCS sessions, spaced not more than a day apart. Data was extracted on AEs reported, total tDCS exposure (cumulative charge), and diagnostic groups (Healthy, Pain Disorder, Stroke, Neurocognitive Disorder, Neuropsychiatric Disorder, and Other). Univariate simple linear meta-regression analyses examined AE likelihood, comparing active and sham tDCS, with increasing exposure. Rates of AEs were compared for diagnostic groups.
RESULTS: 158 studies (total 4130 participants) met inclusion criteria and were included for quantitative analyses. The incidence of AEs (examined per session, by proportion of participants, and by the number of studies reporting AEs) did not increase with higher levels of tDCS exposure. Furthermore, AE rates were not found to be greater for any diagnostic group.
CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence was found to suggest that repeated sessions of active tDCS pose increased risk to participants compared to sham tDCS within the limits of parameters used to date. Increased risks associated with greater levels of exposure to tDCS, or rare and under-reported AEs, however, cannot be ruled out.},

Understanding the spatial extent of gamma and its relationship to spiking activity is critical for interpreting this signal and elucidating its function, but previous studies have provided widely disparate views of these properties. We addressed these issues by simultaneously recording LFPs and spiking activity using microelectrode arrays implanted in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys. We find that the spatial extent of gamma and its relationship to local spiking activity is stimulus dependent. Small gratings, and those masked with noise, induce a broadband increase in spectral power. This signal is tuned similarly to spiking activity and has limited spatial coherence. Large gratings, however, induce a gamma rhythm characterized by a distinctive spectral “bump,” which is coherent across widely separated sites. This signal is well tuned, but its stimulus preference is similar across millimeters of cortex. The preference of this global gamma rhythm is sensitive to adaptation, in a manner consistent with its magnifying a bias in the neuronal representation of visual stimuli. Gamma thus arises from two sources that reflect different spatial scales of neural ensemble activity. Our results show that there is not a single, fixed ensemble contributing to gamma and that the selectivity of gamma cannot be used to infer its spatial extent.},

To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and deep layers of V1, V2, and V4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40–60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6–16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers.

The protocol implemented was as follows: gamma frequency 200 μA over the bilateral frontal lobe for 20 min over 2 weeks. The following tests were conducted: excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recording, Western blot analysis (cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) proteins, phosphorylated CREB proteins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and parvalbumin) to examine the synaptic plasticity. The EPSP was remarkably increased in the AD-T group compared with in the AD-NT group. In the Western blot analysis, the differences among the groups were not significant.

A meta-analysis was performed on the results of 47 experiments reported in 21 studies. Random effects modelling of the effect sizes showed that beta-tACS significantly increases M1 excitability (Ē = 0.287, 95\% CI = 0.133–0.440). Further analysis showed that tACS intensities above 1 mA peak-to-peak yield a robust increase in M1 excitability, whereas intensities of 1 mA peak-to-peak and below do not induce a reliable change. Additionally, results showed an impact of tACS montages on these effects. No difference in effect size for online compared to offline application of tACS was found. In conclusion, these findings indicate that beta-tACS can increase cortical excitability if stimulation intensity is above 1 mA, yet more research is needed to titrate the stimulation parameters that yield optimal results.},

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)—a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that modulates cortical oscillations through entrainment—has been demonstrated to alter oscillatory activity and enhance cognition in healthy adults. TACS is being explored as a tool to improve cognition and memory in patient populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Objective
To review the growing body of literature and current findings obtained from the application of tACS in patients with MCI or AD, highlighting the effects of gamma tACS on brain function, memory, and cognition. Evidence on the use of brain stimulation in animal models of AD is also discussed. Important parameters of stimulation are underscored for consideration in protocols that aim to apply tACS as a therapeutic tool in patients with MCI/AD.
Findings
The application of gamma tACS has shown promising results in the improvement of cognitive and memory processes that are impacted in patients with MCI/AD. These data demonstrate the potential for tACS as an interventional stand-alone tool or alongside pharmacological and/or other behavioral interventions in MCI/AD.
Conclusions
While the use of tACS in MCI/AD has evidenced encouraging results, the effects of this stimulation technique on brain function and pathophysiology in MCI/AD remains to be fully determined. This review explores the literature and highlights the need for continued research on tACS as a tool to alter the course of the disease by reinstating oscillatory activity, improving cognitive and memory processing, delaying disease progression, and remediating cognitive abilities in patients with MCI/AD.},

	abstract = {Specific frequency bands of neural oscillations have been correlated with a range of cognitive and behavioral effects (e.g., memory and attention). The causal role of specific frequencies may be investigated using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method. TACS involves applying a sinusoidal current between two or more electrodes attached on the scalp, above neural regions that are implicated in cognitive processes of interest. The theorized mechanisms by which tACS affects neural oscillations have implications for the exact stimulation frequency used, as well as its anticipated effects. This review outlines two main mechanisms that are thought to underlie tACS effects – entrainment, and spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Entrainment suggests that the stimulated frequency synchronizes the ongoing neural oscillations, and is thought to be most effective when the stimulated frequency is at or close to the endogenous frequency of the targeted neural network. STDP suggests that stimulation leads to synaptic changes based on the timing of neuronal firing in the target neural network. According to the principles of STDP, synaptic strength is thought to increase when pre-synaptic events occur prior to post-synaptic events (referred to as long-term potentiation, LTP). Conversely, when post-synaptic events occur prior to pre-synaptic events, synapses are thought to be weakened (referred to as long-term depression, LTD). In this review, we summarize the theoretical frameworks and critically review the tACS evidence for each hypothesis. We also discuss whether each mechanism alone can account for tACS effects or whether a combined account is necessary.},

	abstract = {Objective. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can be used to non-invasively entrain neural activity and thereby cause changes in local neural oscillatory power. Despite its increased use in cognitive and clinical neuroscience, the fundamental mechanisms of tACS are still not fully understood. Approach. We developed a computational neuronal network model of two-compartment pyramidal neurons (PY) and inhibitory interneurons, which mimic the local cortical circuits. We modeled tACS with electric field strengths that are achievable in human applications. We then simulated intrinsic network activity and measured neural entrainment to investigate how tACS modulates ongoing endogenous oscillations. Main results. The intensity-specific effects of tACS are non-linear. At low intensities ({\textless}0.3 mV mm−1), tACS desynchronizes neural firing relative to the endogenous oscillations. At higher intensities ({\textgreater}0.3 mV mm−1), neurons are entrained to the exogenous electric field. We then further explore the stimulation parameter space and find that the entrainment of ongoing cortical oscillations also depends on stimulation frequency by following an Arnold tongue. Moreover, neuronal networks can amplify the tACS-induced entrainment via synaptic coupling and network effects. Our model shows that PY are directly entrained by the exogenous electric field and drive the inhibitory neurons. Significance. The results presented in this study provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the intensity- and frequency-specific effects of oscillating electric fields on neuronal networks. This is crucial for rational parameter selection for tACS in cognitive studies and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular method for modulating brain activity noninvasively. In particular, tACS is often used as a targeted intervention that enhances a neural oscillation at a specific frequency to affect a particular behavior. However, these interventions often yield highly variable results. Here, we provide a potential explanation for this variability: tACS competes with the brain's ongoing oscillations. Using neural recordings from alert nonhuman primates, we find that when neural firing is independent of ongoing brain oscillations, tACS readily entrains spiking activity, but when neurons are strongly entrained to ongoing oscillations, tACS often causes a decrease in entrainment instead. Consequently, tACS can yield categorically different results on neural activity, even when the stimulation protocol is fixed. Mathematical analysis suggests that this competition is likely to occur under many experimental conditions. Attempting to impose an external rhythm on the brain may therefore often yield precisely the opposite effect.},

	abstract = {Spike timing is thought to play a critical role in neural computation and communication. Methods for adjusting spike timing are therefore of great interest to researchers and clinicians alike. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a noninvasive technique that uses weak electric fields to manipulate brain activity. Early results have suggested that this technique can improve subjects' behavioral performance on a wide range of tasks and ameliorate some clinical conditions. Nevertheless, considerable skepticism remains about its efficacy, especially because the electric fields reaching the brain during tES are small, whereas the likelihood of indirect effects is large. Our understanding of its effects in humans is largely based on extrapolations from simple model systems and indirect measures of neural activity. As a result, fundamental questions remain about whether and how tES can influence neuronal activity in the human brain. Here, we demonstrate that tES, as typically applied to humans, affects the firing patterns of individual neurons in alert nonhuman primates, which are the best available animal model for the human brain. Specifically, tES consistently influences the timing, but not the rate, of spiking activity within the targeted brain region. Such effects are frequency- and location-specific and can reach deep brain structures; control experiments show that they cannot be explained by sensory stimulation or other indirect influences. These data thus provide a strong mechanistic rationale for the use of tES in humans and will help guide the development of future tES applications.},

Although some promising preliminary data have been reported for applications ranging from stroke rehabilitation to cognitive enhancement, little is known about how tDCS affects the human brain, and some studies have concluded that it may have no effect at all. Here, we describe a macaque model of tDCS that allows us to simultaneously examine the effects of tDCS on brain activity and behavior. We find that applying tDCS to right prefrontal cortex improves monkeys' performance on an associative learning task. While firing rates do not change within the targeted area, tDCS does induce large low-frequency oscillations in the underlying tissue. These oscillations alter functional connectivity, both locally and between distant brain areas, and these long-range changes correlate with tDCS's effects on behavior. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that tDCS leads to widespread changes in brain activity and suggest that it may be a valuable method for cheaply and non-invasively altering functional connectivity in humans.},

Here we determine the effect of applied electric fields on membrane potentials and coherent network oscillations. Applied DC electric fields change transmembrane potentials in CA3 pyramidal cell somata by 0.18 mV per V m(-1) applied. AC sinusoidal electric fields have smaller effects on transmembrane potentials: sensitivity drops as an exponential decay function of frequency. At 50 and 60 Hz it is approximately 0.4 that for DC fields. Effects of fields of {\textless} or = 16 V m(-1) peak-to-peak (p-p) did not outlast application. Kainic acid (100 nm) induced coherent network oscillations in the beta and gamma bands (15-100 Hz). Applied fields of {\textgreater} or = 6 V m(-1) p-p (2.1 V m(-1) r.m.s.) shifted the gamma peak in the power spectrum to centre on the applied field frequency or a subharmonic. Statistically significant effects on the timing of pyramidal cell firing within the oscillation appeared at distinct thresholds: at 50 Hz, 1 V m(-1) p-p (354 mV m(-1) r.m.s.) had statistically significant effects in 71\% of slices, and 0.5 V m(-1) p-p (177 mV m(-1) r.m.s.) in 20\%. These threshold fields are consistent with current environmental guidelines. They correspond to changes in somatic potential of approximately 70 microV, below membrane potential noise levels for neurons, demonstrating the emergent properties of neuronal networks can be more sensitive than measurable effects in single neurons.},

Electric fields were generated by sinusoid patterns at slow frequency (0.8, 1.25 or 1.7 Hz) via electrodes placed on the surface of the skull or the dura. Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) reliably entrained neurons in widespread cortical areas, including the hippocampus. The percentage of TES phase-locked neurons increased with stimulus intensity and depended on the behavioral state of the animal. TES-induced voltage gradient, as low as 1 mV/mm at the recording sites, was sufficient to phase-bias neuronal spiking. Intracellular recordings showed that both spiking and subthreshold activity were under the combined influence of TES forced fields and network activity. We suggest that TES in chronic preparations may be used for experimental and therapeutic control of brain activity.},

Tau P301S and CK-p25 mice subjected to chronic, daily GENUS from the early stages of neurodegeneration showed a preservation of neuronal and synaptic density across multiple brain areas and modified cognitive performance.

	abstract = {The neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in synaptic plasticity. The effects depend on receptor subtypes, affinity, concentration level, and the kind of neuroplasticity induced. In animal experiments, dopamine D2-like receptor stimulation revealed partially antagonistic effects on plasticity, which might be explained by dosage dependency. In humans, D2 receptor block abolishes plasticity, and the D2/D3, but predominantly D3, receptor agonist ropinirol has a dosage-dependent nonlinear affect on plasticity. Here we aimed to determine the specific affect of D2 receptor activation on neuroplasticity in humans, because physiological effects of D2 and D3 receptors might differ. Therefore, we combined application of the selective D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine (2.5, 10, and 20 mg or placebo medication) with anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which induces nonfocal plasticity, and with paired associative stimulation (PAS) generating a more focal kind of plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy humans. Plasticity was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potential amplitudes. For facilitatory tDCS, bromocriptine prevented plasticity induction independent from drug dosage. However, its application resulted in an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve on inhibitory tDCS, excitability-diminishing PAS, and to a minor degree on excitability-enhancing PAS. These data support the assumption that modulation of D2-like receptor activity exerts a nonlinear dose-dependent effect on neuroplasticity in the human motor cortex that differs from predominantly D3 receptor activation and that the kind of plasticity-induction procedure is relevant for its specific impact.},

A 1-stage dose-response meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test robustness of the findings. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline.The main outcome was the near-maximal effective doses of total pulses received for TMS and total current dose in coulombs for tDCS.A total of 110 studies with 4820 participants (2659 men [61.4\%]; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [8.8] years) were included. The following significant dose-response associations emerged with bell-shaped curves: (1) in schizophrenia, high-frequency (HF) TMS on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC) for negative symptoms (χ2 = 9.35; df = 2; P = .009) and TMS on the left temporoparietal junction for resistant hallucinations (χ2 = 36.52; df = 2; P \&lt; .001); (2) in depression, HF-DLPFC TMS (χ2 = 14.49; df = 2; P \&lt; .001); (3) in treatment-resistant depression, LDLPFC tDCS (χ2 = 14.56; df = 2; P \&lt; .001); and (4) in substance use disorder, LDLPFC tDCS (χ2 = 33.63; df = 2; P \&lt; .001). The following significant dose-response associations emerged with plateaued or ascending curves: (1) in depression, low-frequency (LF) TMS on the right DLPFC (RDLPFC) with ascending curve (χ2 = 25.67; df = 2; P = .001); (2) for treatment-resistant depression, LF TMS on the bilateral DLPFC with ascending curve (χ2 = 5.86; df = 2; P = .004); (3) in obsessive-compulsive disorder, LF-RDLPFC TMS with ascending curve (χ2 = 20.65; df = 2; P \&lt; .001) and LF TMS on the orbitofrontal cortex with a plateaued curve (χ2 = 15.19; df = 2; P \&lt; .001); and (4) in posttraumatic stress disorder, LF-RDLPFC TMS with ascending curve (χ2 = 54.15; df = 2; P \&lt; .001). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the main findings.The study findings suggest that NIBS yields specific outcomes based on dose parameters across various mental disorders and brain regions. Clinicians should consider these dose parameters when prescribing NIBS.

Electroencephalography (EEG) represents a cost-effective and scalable potential measure to predict treatment response to major depressive disorder. We performed separate meta-analyses to determine the ability of models to distinguish between responders and non-responders using EEG across treatments, as well as a performed subgroup analysis of response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and antidepressants (Registration Number: CRD42021257477) in Major Depressive Disorder by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between January 1960 and February 2022. We included 15 studies that predicted treatment responses among patients with major depressive disorder using machine-learning techniques. Within a random-effects model with a restricted maximum likelihood estimator comprising 758 patients, the pooled accuracy across studies was 83.93\% (95\% CI: 78.90–89.29), with an Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of 0.850 (95\% CI: 0.747–0.890), and partial AUC of 0.779. The average sensitivity and specificity across models were 77.96\% (95\% CI: 60.05–88.70), and 84.60\% (95\% CI: 67.89–92.39), respectively. In a subgroup analysis, greater performance was observed in predicting response to rTMS (Pooled accuracy: 85.70\% (95\% CI: 77.45–94.83), Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC): 0.928, partial AUC: 0.844), relative to antidepressants (Pooled accuracy: 81.41\% (95\% CI: 77.45–94.83, AUC: 0.895, pAUC: 0.821). Furthermore, across all meta-analyses, the specificity (true negatives) of EEG models was greater than the sensitivity (true positives), suggesting that EEG models thus far better identify non-responders than responders to treatment in MDD. Studies varied widely in important features across models, although relevant features included absolute and relative power in frontal and temporal electrodes, measures of connectivity, and asymmetry across hemispheres. Predictive models of treatment response using EEG hold promise in major depressive disorder, although there is a need for prospective model validation in independent datasets, and a greater emphasis on replicating physiological markers. Crucially, standardization in cut-off values and clinical scales for defining clinical response and non-response will aid in the reproducibility of findings and the clinical utility of predictive models. Furthermore, several models thus far have used data from open-label trials with small sample sizes and evaluated performance in the absence of training and testing sets, which increases the risk of statistical overfitting. Large consortium studies are required to establish predictive signatures of treatment response using EEG, and better elucidate the replicability of specific markers. Additionally, it is speculated that greater performance was observed in rTMS models, since EEG is assessing neural networks more likely to be directly targeted by rTMS, comprising electrical activity primarily near the surface of the cortex. Prospectively, there is a need for models that examine the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments across the same patients. However, this will require a thoughtful consideration towards cumulative treatment effects, and whether washout periods between treatments should be utilised. Regardless, longitudinal cross-over trials comparing multiple treatments across the same group of patients will be an important prerequisite step to both facilitate precision psychiatry and identify generalizable physiological predictors of response between and across treatment options.},

	abstract = {The alterations of functional connectivity brain networks in major depressive disorder (MDD) have been subject of a large number of studies. Using different methodologies and focusing on diverse aspects of the disease, research shows heterogeneous results lacking integration. Disrupted network connectivity has been found in core MDD networks like the default mode network (DMN), the central executive network (CEN), and the salience network, but also in cerebellar and thalamic circuitries. Here we review literature published on resting state brain network function in MDD focusing on methodology, and clinical characteristics including symptomatology and antidepressant treatment related findings. There are relatively few investigations concerning the qualitative aspects of symptomatology of MDD, whereas most studies associate quantitative aspects with distinct resting state functional connectivity alterations. Such depression severity associated alterations are found in the DMN, frontal, cerebellar and thalamic brain regions as well as the insula and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Similarly, different therapeutical options in MDD and their effects on brain function showed patchy results. Herein, pharmaceutical treatments reveal functional connectivity alterations throughout multiple brain regions notably the DMN, fronto-limbic, and parieto-temporal regions. Psychotherapeutical interventions show significant functional connectivity alterations in fronto-limbic networks, whereas electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation result in alterations of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, the DMN, the CEN and the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. While it appears clear that functional connectivity alterations are associated with the pathophysiology and treatment of MDD, future research should also generate a common strategy for data acquisition and analysis, as a least common denominator, to set the basis for comparability across studies and implementation of functional connectivity as a scientifically and clinically useful biomarker.},

There are clinical data that support the efficacy of many different approaches to rTMS treatment, and it remains unclear what combination of stimulation parameters is optimal to relieve depressive symptoms. Because of the costs and complexity of studies that would be necessary to explore and compare the large number of combinations of rTMS treatment parameters, it would be useful to establish reliable surrogate biomarkers of treatment efficacy that could be used to compare different approaches to treatment. This study reviews the evidence that neurophysiologic measures of cortical excitability could be used as biomarkers for screening different rTMS treatment paradigms. It examines evidence that: (1) changes in excitability are related to the mechanism of action of rTMS; (2) rTMS has consistent effects on measures of excitability that could constitute reliable biomarkers; and (3) changes in excitability are related to the outcomes of rTMS treatment of MDD. An increasing body of evidence indicates that these neurophysiologic measures have the potential to serve as reliable biomarkers for screening different approaches to rTMS treatment of MDD.},

Here we focus on electroencephalography (EEG) or direct scalp voltage recordings as such a biomarker, with an emphasis on gamma and high gamma oscillations (or “rhythms”). In the last several decades, alpha and theta band rhythms have been found to provide information on depressive state as well as recovery, but the gamma band is less well characterized with respect to depression. We summarize some key findings on gamma rhythms (especially their amplitude) as a biomarker or endophenotype for major depression. These studies suggest: (1) under certain conditions gamma rhythms can distinguish subjects with major depression from healthy controls, (2) gamma may distinguish bipolar disorder from unipolar depression, (3) various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments that counteract depression also alter gamma, (4) animal models of depression-like behavior show gamma abnormalities, with changes in gamma associated with therapeutic recovery. The most informative approaches in the future may combine profiles of gamma band power across the brain to assess ratios of activity across regions. Overall we have good evidence to suggest that gamma rhythms may provide objective information on major depressive disease status, but we will need further work to better define the precise measures to follow.},

	abstract = {Deep learning methods are increasingly being applied to raw electro-encephalogram (EEG) data. However, if these models are to be used in clinical or research contexts, methods to explain them must be developed, and if these models are to be used in research contexts, methods for combining explanations across large numbers of models must be developed to counteract the inherent randomness of existing training approaches. Model visualization-based explainability methods for EEG involve structuring a model architecture such that its extracted features can be characterized and have the potential to offer highly useful insights into the patterns that they uncover. Nevertheless, model visualization-based explainability methods have been underexplored within the context of multichannel EEG, and methods to combine their explanations across folds have not yet been developed. In this study, we present two novel convolutional neural network-based architectures and apply them for automated major depressive disorder diagnosis. Our models obtain slightly lower classification performance than a baseline architecture. However, across 50 training folds, they find that individuals with MDD exhibit higher β power, potentially higher δ power, and higher brain-wide correlation that is most strongly represented within the right hemisphere. This study provides multiple key insights into MDD and represents a significant step forward for the domain of explainable deep learning applied to raw EEG. We hope that it will inspire future efforts that will eventually enable the development of explainable EEG deep learning models that can contribute both to clinical care and novel medical research discoveries.},

	abstract = {Biological psychiatry aims to understand mental disorders in terms of altered neurobiological pathways. However, for one of the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), no informative biomarkers have been identified.To evaluate whether machine learning (ML) can identify a multivariate biomarker for MDD.This study used data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Disorders Cohort Study, a case-control clinical neuroimaging study. Patients with acute or lifetime MDD and healthy controls aged 18 to 65 years were recruited from primary care and the general population in Münster and Marburg, Germany, from September 11, 2014, to September 26, 2018. The Münster Neuroimaging Cohort (MNC) was used as an independent partial replication sample. Data were analyzed from April 2022 to June 2023.Patients with MDD and healthy controls.Diagnostic classification accuracy was quantified on an individual level using an extensive ML-based multivariate approach across a comprehensive range of neuroimaging modalities, including structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging as well as a polygenic risk score for depression.Of 1801 included participants, 1162 (64.5\%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 36.1 (13.1) years. There were a total of 856 patients with MDD (47.5\%) and 945 healthy controls (52.5\%). The MNC replication sample included 1198 individuals (362 with MDD [30.1\%] and 836 healthy controls [69.9\%]). Training and testing a total of 4 million ML models, mean (SD) accuracies for diagnostic classification ranged between 48.1\% (3.6\%) and 62.0\% (4.8\%). Integrating neuroimaging modalities and stratifying individuals based on age, sex, treatment, or remission status does not enhance model performance. Findings were replicated within study sites and also observed in structural magnetic resonance imaging within MNC. Under simulated conditions of perfect reliability, performance did not significantly improve. Analyzing model errors suggests that symptom severity could be a potential focus for identifying MDD subgroups.Despite the improved predictive capability of multivariate compared with univariate neuroimaging markers, no informative individual-level MDD biomarker—even under extensive ML optimization in a large sample of diagnosed patients—could be identified.},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence showed that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with disruptions of brain structural and functional networks, rather than impairment of isolated brain region. Thus, connectome-based models capable of predicting the depression severity at the individual level can be clinically useful. Here, we applied a machine-learning approach to predict the severity of depression using resting-state networks derived from source-reconstructed Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Using regression models and three independent EEG datasets (N = 328), we tested whether resting state functional connectivity could predict individual depression score. On the first dataset, results showed that individuals scores could be reasonably predicted (r = 0.6, p = 4 × 10–18) using intrinsic functional connectivity in the EEG alpha band (8–13 Hz). In particular, the brain regions which contributed the most to the predictive network belong to the default mode network. We further tested the predictive potential of the established model by conducting two external validations on (N1 = 53, N2 = 154). Results showed statistically significant correlations between the predicted and the measured depression scale scores (r1 = 0.52, r2 = 0.44, p {\textless} 0.001). These findings lay the foundation for developing a generalizable and scientifically interpretable EEG network-based markers that can ultimately support clinicians in a biologically-based characterization of MDD.},

Recently, however, multiple studies failed to confirm this effect, questioning its reproducibility. Our purpose is to thoroughly test the validity of FAA in depression by conducting a multiverse analysis – running many related analyses and testing the sensitivity of the effect to changes in the analytical approach – on data from five independent studies. Only 13 of the 270 analyses revealed significant results.

	abstract = {Work in the last two decades has shown that neural mass models (NMM) can realistically reproduce and explain epileptic seizure transitions as recorded by electrophysiological methods (EEG, SEEG). In previous work, advances were achieved by increasing excitation and heuristically varying network inhibitory coupling parameters in the models. Based on these early studies, we provide a laminar NMM capable of realistically reproducing the electrical activity recorded by SEEG in the epileptogenic zone during interictal to ictal states. With the exception of the external noise input into the pyramidal cell population, the model dynamics are autonomous. By setting the system at a point close to bifurcation, seizure-like transitions are generated, including pre-ictal spikes, low voltage fast activity, and ictal rhythmic activity. A novel element in the model is a physiologically motivated algorithm for chloride dynamics: the gain of GABAergic post-synaptic potentials is modulated by the pathological accumulation of chloride in pyramidal cells due to high inhibitory input and/or dysfunctional chloride transport. In addition, in order to simulate SEEG signals for comparison with real seizure recordings, the NMM is embedded first in a layered model of the neocortex and then in a realistic physical model. We compare modeling results with data from four epilepsy patient cases. By including key pathophysiological mechanisms, the proposed framework captures succinctly the electrophysiological phenomenology observed in ictal states, paving the way for robust personalization methods based on NMMs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by diffuse amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) aggregates as well as neuroinflammation. Exogenously-induced 40 Hz gamma oscillations have been showing to reduce Aβ and p-Tau deposition presumably via microglia activation in AD mouse models.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to translate preclinical data on gamma-induction in AD patients by means of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).
METHODS: Four participants with mild-to-moderate AD received 1 h of daily 40 Hz (gamma) tACS for 4 weeks (Monday to Friday) targeting the bitemporal lobes (20 h treatment duration). Participant underwent Aβ, p-Tau, and microglia PET imaging with [11C]-PiB, [18F]-FTP, and [11C]-PBR28 respectively, before and after the intervention along with electrophysiological assessment.
RESULTS: No adverse events were reported, and an increase in gamma spectral power on EEG was observed after the treatment. [18F]-FTP PET revealed a significant decrease over 2\% of p-Tau burden in 3/4 patients following the tACS treatment, primarily involving the temporal lobe regions targeted by tACS and especially mesial regions (e.g., entorhinal cortex). The amount of intracerebral Aβ as measured by [11C]-PiB was not significantly influenced by tACS, whereas 1/4 reported a significant decrease of microglia activation as measured by [11C]-PBR28.
CONCLUSION: tACS seems to represent a safe and feasible option for gamma induction in AD patients, with preliminary evidence of a possible effect on protein clearance partially mimicking what is observed in animal models. Longer interventions and placebo control conditions are needed to fully evaluate the potential for tACS to slow disease progression.},

	abstract = {PurposeTranscranial electrical current stimulation (tES or tCS, as it is sometimes referred to) has been proposed as non-invasive therapy for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. This technique, which includes direct current (tDCS) and alternating current (tACS) stimulation involves the application of weak currents across the cortex to change cortical excitability. Although clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of tES, its specific effects on epileptic brain activity are poorly understood. We sought to summarize the clinical and fundamental effects underlying the application of tES in epilepsy.MethodsA systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A database search was performed in PUBMED, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL for articles corresponding to the keywords “epilepsy AND (transcranial current stimulation OR transcranial electrical stimulation)”.ResultsA total of 56 studies were included in this review. Through these records, we show that tDCS and tACS epileptic patients are safe and clinically relevant techniques for epilepsy. Recent articles reported changes of functional connectivity in epileptic patients after tDCS. We argue that tDCS may act by affecting brain networks, rather than simply modifying local activity in the targeted area. To explain the mechanisms of tES, various cellular effects have been identified. Among them, reduced cell loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and hippocampal BDNF protein levels. Brain modeling and human studies highlight the influence of individual brain anatomy and physiology on the electric field distribution. Computational models may optimize the stimulation parameters and bring new therapeutic perspectives.ConclusionBoth tDCS and tACS are promising techniques for epilepsy patients. Although the clinical effects of tDCS have been repeatedly assessed, only one clinical trial has involved a consistent number of epileptic patients and little knowledge is present about the clinical outcome of tACS. To fill this gap, multicenter studies on tES in epileptic patients are needed involving novel methods such as personalized stimulation protocols based on computational modeling. Furthermore, there is a need for more in vivo studies replicating the tES parameters applied in patients. Finally, there is a lack of clinical studies investigating changes in intracranial epileptiform discharges during tES application, which could clarify the nature of tES-related local and network dynamics in epilepsy.},

	abstract = {Although it is well-admitted that transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) allows for interacting with brain endogenous rhythms, the exact mechanisms by which externally-applied fields modulate the activity of neurons remain elusive. In this study a novel computational model (a neural mass model including subpopulations of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons mediating synaptic currents with either slow or fast kinetics) of the cerebral cortex was elaborated to investigate the local effects of tDCS on neuronal populations based on an in-vivo experimental study. Model parameters were adjusted to reproduce evoked potentials (EPs) recorded from the somatosensory cortex of the rabbit in response to air-puffs applied on the whiskers. EPs were simulated under control condition (no tDCS) as well as under anodal and cathodal tDCS fields. Results first revealed that a feed-forward inhibition mechanism must be included in the model for accurate simulation of actual EPs (peaks and latencies). Interestingly, results revealed that externally-applied fields are also likely to affect interneurons. Indeed, when interneurons get polarized then the characteristics of simulated EPs become closer to those of real EPs. In particular, under anodal tDCS condition, more realistic EPs could be obtained when pyramidal cells were depolarized and, simultaneously, slow (resp. fast) interneurons became de- (resp. hyper-) polarized. Geometrical characteristics of interneurons might provide some explanations for this effect.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been successfully applied for modulation of cortical excitability. tDCS is capable of inducing changes in neuronal membrane potentials in a polarity-dependent manner. When tDCS is of sufficient length, synaptically driven after-effects are induced. The mechanisms underlying these after-effects are largely unknown, and there is a compelling need for animal models to test the immediate effects and after-effects induced by tDCS in different cortical areas and evaluate the implications in complex cerebral processes. Here we show in behaving rabbits that tDCS applied over the somatosensory cortex modulates cortical processes consequent to localized stimulation of the whisker pad or of the corresponding area of the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic nucleus. With longer stimulation periods, poststimulation effects were observed in the somatosensory cortex only after cathodal tDCS. Consistent with the polarity-specific effects, the acquisition of classical eyeblink conditioning was potentiated or depressed by the simultaneous application of anodal or cathodal tDCS, respectively, when stimulation of the whisker pad was used as conditioned stimulus, suggesting that tDCS modulates the sensory perception process necessary for associative learning. We also studied the putative mechanisms underlying immediate effects and after-effects of tDCS observed in the somatosensory cortex. Results when pairs of pulses applied to the thalamic VPM nucleus (mediating sensory input) during anodal and cathodal tDCS suggest that tDCS modifies thalamocortical synapses at presynaptic sites. Finally, we show that blocking the activation of adenosine A1 receptors prevents the long-term depression (LTD) evoked in the somatosensory cortex after cathodal tDCS.},

	abstract = {Aim To investigate neural oscillatory networks in major depressive disorder (MDD), effects of home-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment, and potential predictors of treatment remission.
Methods In a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of home-based tDCS treatment, EEG data were acquired a subset: 21 MDD participants (16 women) (mean age 36.63 ± 9.71 years) in current depressive episode of moderate to severe severity (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score 18.42 ± 1.80). Participants were randomised to either active (n=11) or sham tDCS (n=8). Treatment was home-based tDCS treatment for 10 weeks in a bifrontal montage (anode over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) consisting of 5 sessions per week for 3 weeks and 3 sessions per week for 7 weeks. Active tDCS was 2mA and sham tDCS 0mA with brief ramp up and ramp down period to mimic active stimulation. Each session was 30 minutes. Clinical remission was defined as HAMD score ≤ 7. Resting-state EEG data were acquired at baseline, prior to the start of treatment, and at 10-week end of treatment. EEG data were acquired using portable 4-channel EEG device (electrode positions: AF7, AF8, TP9, TP10). EEG band power was extracted for each electrode and functional connectivity phase synchronization by phase locking value (PLV). Deep learning was applied to baseline PLV features to identify predictors of treatment remission.
Results Main effect of group was observed in gamma PLV in frontal and temporal regions, in which active tDCS treatment group showed higher connectivity as compared to sham group. In active treatment group, significant positive correlations between changes in delta, theta, alpha, and beta PLV and improvement in depression severity were observed. The highest treatment remission prediction was achieved by combining PLV features from theta, alpha, and beta: accuracy 71.94\% (sensitivity 52.88\%, specificity 83.06\%).
Conclusions Synchronized brain activity across large-scale networks as reflected in gamma PLV is a potential mechanism of active tDCS as compared to placebo-sham tDCS. Baseline resting-state EEG is a potential predictor of treatment remission. Home-based EEG measures are feasible and potentially useful predictors of clinical outcome.},

This study investigates the impact of tDCS in individuals with MDD using resting-state EEG data and network neuroscience to analyze functional connectivity. We examined power spectral density (PSD) changes and functional connectivity (FC) patterns across theta, alpha, and beta bands before and after tDCS intervention. A notable aspect of this research involves the modification of the binarizing threshold algorithm to assess functional connectivity networks, facilitating a meaningful comparison at the group level. Our analysis using optimal threshold binarization techniques revealed significant modifications in network topology, particularly evident in the beta band, indicative of reduced randomization or enhanced small-worldness after tDCS. Furthermore, the hubness analysis identified specific brain regions, notably the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regions across all frequency bands, exhibiting increased functional connectivity, suggesting their involvement in the antidepressant effects of tDCS. Notably, tDCS intervention transformed the dispersed high connectivity into localized connectivity and increased left-sided asymmetry across all frequency bands. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of tDCS on neural mechanisms in MDD, offering a potential direction for further research and therapeutic development in the field of neuromodulation for mental health disorders.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at rest can influence behaviors. However, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study examined the effect of a single session of tDCS over the bilateral DLPFC on resting-state functional connectivity using fMRI (rs-fcMRI) during and after stimulation in healthy adults. We also investigated whether baseline rs-fcMRI predicted tDCS-induced changes in rs-fcMRI.
METHODS: This was a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. We delivered tDCS for 30 min at 1 mA with the anode and cathode over the left and right DLPFC, respectively. We used seed-based analyses to measure tDCS-induced effects on whole-brain rs-fcMRI using a 3 (before, during, after stimulation) × 2 (active, sham stimulation) ANOVA.
RESULTS: There were four significant Time × Stimulation interactions on the connectivity scores with the left DLPFC seed (under the anode electrode) and no interactions for the right DLPFC seed (under the cathode electrode). tDCS changed rs-fcMRI between the left DLPFC seed and parieto-occipital, parietal, parieto-occipitotemporal, and frontal clusters during and after stimulation, as compared to sham. Furthermore, rs-fcMRI prior to stimulation predicted some of these tDCS-induced changes in rs-fcMRI during and after stimulation. For instance, rs-fcMRI of the fronto-parietooccipital network predicted changes observed after active stimulation, rs-fcMRI of the fronto-parietal network predicted changes during active stimulation, whereas rs-fcMRI of the fronto-parieto-occipitotemporal and the frontal networks predicted changes both during and after active stimulation.
DISCUSSION: Our findings reveal that tDCS modulated rs-fcMRI both during and after stimulation mainly in regions distal, but also in those proximal to the area under the anode electrode, which were predicted by rs-fcMRI prior to tDCS. It might be worth considering rs-fcMRI to optimize response to tDCS.},

        , Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a promising intervention in clinical and behavioral neuroscience; however, the response variability to this technique has limited its impact, partly due to the widespread of current flow with conventional methods. Here, we investigate whether a more targeted, focal approach over the primary motor cortex (M1) is advantageous for motor learning and targeting specific neuronal populations. Our preliminary results show that focal stimulation leads to enhanced skill learning and differentially recruits distinct pathways to M1. This finding suggests that focal tDCS approaches may improve the outcomes of future studies aiming to enhance behavior.},

Neural oscillations exhibit phase-dependent associations with cognitive functions, and tools to manipulate local oscillatory phases can affect communication across remote brain regions. A recent study demonstrated that multi-channel tACS can generate electric fields with a phase gradient or traveling waves in the brain. Computational simulations using phasor algebra can predict the phase distribution inside the brain and aid in informing parameters in tACS experiments. However, experimental validation of computational models for multi-phase tACS is still lacking. Here, we develop such a framework for phasor simulation and evaluate its accuracy using in vivo recordings in nonhuman primates. We extract the phase and amplitude of electric fields from intracranial recordings in two monkeys during multi-channel tACS and compare them to those calculated by phasor analysis using finite element models. Our findings demonstrate that simulated phases correspond well to measured phases (r = 0.9). Further, we systematically evaluated the impact of accurate electrode placement on modeling and data agreement. Finally, our framework can predict the amplitude distribution in measurements given calibrated tissues’ conductivity. Our validated general framework for simulating multi-phase, multi-electrode tACS provides a streamlined tool for principled planning of multi-channel tACS experiments.},

The possibility to noninvasively interact and selectively modulate the activity of networks would open to relevant applications in neuroscience. Here we tested a novel approach for multichannel, network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS), optimized to increase excitability of the sensorimotor network (SMN) while inducing cathodal inhibitory modulation over prefrontal and parietal brain regions negatively correlated with the SMN. Using an MRI-compatible multichannel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) device, 20 healthy participants underwent real and sham tDCS while at rest in the MRI scanner. Changes in functional connectivity (FC) during and after stimulation were evaluated, looking at the intrinsic FC of the SMN and the strength of the negative connectivity between SMN and the rest of the brain. Standard, bifocal tDCS targeting left motor cortex (electrode {\textasciitilde}C3) and right frontopolar ({\textasciitilde}Fp2) regions was tested as a control condition in a separate sample of healthy subjects to investigate network specificity of multichannel stimulation effects. Net-tDCS induced greater FC increase over the SMN compared to bifocal tDCS, during and after stimulation. Moreover, exploratory analysis of the impact of net-tDCS on negatively correlated networks showed an increase in the negative connectivity between SMN and prefrontal/parietal areas targeted by cathodal stimulation both during and after real net-tDCS. Results suggest preliminary evidence of the possibility of manipulating distributed network connectivity patterns through net-tDCS, with potential relevance for the development of cognitive enhancement and therapeutic tES solutions.},

However, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory interneurons are resistant to Aβ deposition, and Aβ decreases synaptic glutamatergic transmission to decrease neural network activity. Furthermore, there is now evidence suggesting that neural network activity is aberrantly increased in AD patients and animal models due to functional deficits in and decreased activity of GABA inhibitory interneurons, contributing to cognitive deficits. Here we describe the roles played by excitatory neurons and GABA inhibitory interneurons in Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and how altered GABA interneurons regulate AD neuropathology.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique able to transiently modulate brain activity, is surging as one of the most promising therapeutic solutions in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, profound limitations exist in current placebo (sham) protocols that limit single- and double-blinding, especially in non-naïve subjects.
OBJECTIVE: To ensure better blinding and strengthen reliability of tDCS studies and trials, we tested a new optimization algorithm aimed at creating an "active" sham tDCS condition (ActiSham hereafter) capable of inducing the same scalp sensations perceived during real stimulation while preventing currents from reaching the cortex and cause changes in brain excitability.
METHODS: A novel model-based multielectrode technique - optimizing the location and currents of a set of small electrodes placed on the scalp - was used to control the relative amount of current delivered transcranially in real and placebo multichannel tDCS conditions. The presence, intensity and localization of scalp sensations during tDCS was evaluated by means of a specifically designed questionnaire administered to the participants. We compared blinding ratings by directly addressing subjects' ability to discriminate across conditions for both traditional (Bifocal-tDCS and Sham, using sponge electrodes) and our novel multifocal approach (both real Multifocal-tDCS and ActiSham). Changes in corticospinal excitability were monitored based on Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) recorded via concurrent Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG).
RESULTS: Participants perceived Multifocal-tDCS and ActiSham similarly in terms of both localization and intensity of scalp sensations, whereas traditional Bifocal stimulation was rated as more painful and annoying compared to its Sham counterpart. Additionally, differences in scalp localization were reported for active/sham Bifocal-tDCS, with Sham tDCS inducing more widespread itching and burning sensations. As for MEPs amplitude, a main effect of stimulation was found when comparing Bifocal-Sham and ActiSham (F(1,13) = 6.67, p = .023), with higher MEPs amplitudes after the application of Bifocal-Sham.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to traditional Bifocal-tDCS, ActiSham offers better participants' blinding by inducing very similar scalp sensations to those of real Multifocal tDCS both in terms of intensity and localization, while not affecting corticospinal excitability.},

	abstract = {Objective
Clinical exploitation of transcranial electrical stimulation for focal epilepsy treatment lacks quantification of the underlying neurophysiological changes. This study explores the immediate effects of transcranial alternating (tACS) and direct (tDCS) current stimulation on local and network brain activity using simultaneous stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) recordings.
Methods
Patients were randomized for personalized tACS (n = 5) or tDCS (n = 6). Active stimulation (20 min) was preceded by sham stimulation (20 min). Changes in interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), functional connectivity (FC) and power spectral density (PSD) were quantified against baseline.
Results
Results demonstrated variable responses. Spike rate decreased in 2/6 subjects following sham and tDCS, while 2/6 showed an increase. Alpha power and aperiodic PSD components generally increased during and after tDCS but decreased following tACS. FC changes varied among subjects and were detectable even during sham sessions.
Conclusions
Strong variability suggests that tES does not have a univocal effect on immediate changes in IED or FC, possibly due to the single session format and challenges in affecting subcortical areas.
Significance
This is the first study to examine intracranial FC changes during tACS and tDCS, highlighting the importance of sham comparisons and individual variability in tES response, offering valuable insights into its application for epilepsy treatment.},

Some of this inter-subject variance is thought to stem from individual differences in head anatomy, which result in different electric field distributions across individuals for the same stimulation settings. In a recent block-randomized, sham-controlled pilot study, 18 older adults with mild-to-moderate motor and cognitive impairments underwent a 2-week, 10-session intervention of 2 mA bipolar tDCS with the anode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cathode over the right supraorbital region (anodal F3 vs. FP2 using sponge electrodes in the 10-20 EEG system). tDCS, compared to sham stimulation, improved average cognitive-motor performance over a two-week follow-up. For a subset of 12 participants from this cohort who underwent structural brain MRIs at baseline, we derived tDCS-induced electric field properties using MRI-derived realistic, individualized finite element modeling. We hypothesized that the electric field component orthogonal (En) to the cortex over the left DLPFC would correlate with observed cognitive-motor improvements. Across the 12 subjects the average tDCS-induced electric field over the target area was highly variable with a standard deviation of the surface average En over the left DLPFC of 21\% of the mean. For those subjects who were randomized to tDCS intervention (n=6), those who exhibited greater improvement in cognitive-motor performance were exposed to greater normal component of the tDCS electric field averaged over the left DLPFC (r95 \% ∈ [−0.99,−0.59]). In contrast, averaged over the right DLPFC, En was a poor predictor of outcome (r95 \% ∈ [−0.08,0.97]), as was the amplitude of the current injected (a widely adopted dosing parameter). In light of these results, we conducted a retrospective modeling experiment using personalized montage optimization algorithms to achieve a desired En amplitude over the left DLPFC. The optimized montages induced an average En on the left DLPFC comparable to the bipolar montages, but with half the variability (standard deviation was 11\% compared to 21\% with bipolar montages). In addition, these results suggest that optimized multichannel montages afford more focal targeting, with lower “spill-over” of electric field onto other cortical areas. These proof-of-concept results, though based upon a small sample size, indicate that assessment of the E-field distribution is critical when evaluating the effects of tDCS intervention. They also reinforce the importance of controlled cortical electric field dosing in tDCS and the potential advantages of optimized multichannel stimulation.
Main findings:
The lDPFC averaged normal component of the electric field correlated with cognitive-motor improvements following tDCS intervention.In older adults, head and brain anatomical differences resulted in high inter-subject variability of tDCS-induced electric fields.tDCS montages optimized from modeling and delivered via multichannel electrode arrays can control variance and maximize electric field on target, while minimizing effects elsewhere.},

Approaches to noninvasively impose these fields on the brain have high therapeutic potential in neurology and psychiatry. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) is hypothesized to affect spike timing and cause neural entrainment. However, the conditions under which these effects occur in vivo are unknown. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the neocortex in awake nonhuman primates during TACS and found dose-dependent neural entrainment to the stimulation waveform. Cluster analysis of changes in interspike intervals identified two main types of neural responses to TACS—increased burstiness and phase entrainment. Our results uncover key mechanisms of TACS and show that the stimulation affects spike timing in the awake primate brain at intensities feasible in humans. Thus, novel TACS protocols tailored to ongoing brain activity may be a tool to normalize spike timing in maladaptive brain networks and neurological disease.},

	abstract = {Objective
The aim is to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying interictal epileptiform discharges observed in electroencephalographic (EEG) and stereo-EEG (SEEG, depth electrodes) recordings performed during pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.
Methods
We developed novel neuro-inspired computational models of the human cerebral cortex at three different levels of description: i) microscale (detailed neuron models), ii) mesoscale (neuronal mass models) and iii) macroscale (whole brain models). Although conceptually different, micro- and mesoscale models share some similar features, such as the typology of neurons (pyramidal cells and three types of interneurons), their spatial arrangement in cortical layers, and their synaptic connectivity (excitatory and inhibitory). The whole brain model consists of a large-scale network of interconnected neuronal masses, with connectivity based on the human connectome.
Results
For these three levels of description, the fine-tuning of free parameters and the quantitative comparison with real data allowed us to reproduce interictal epileptiform discharges with a high degree of fidelity and to formulate hypotheses about the cell- and network-related mechanisms underlying the generation of fast ripples and SEEG-recorded epileptic spikes and spike-waves.
Conclusions
The proposed models provide valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the generation of epileptic events. The knowledge gained from these models effectively complements the clinical analysis of SEEG data collected during the evaluation of patients with epilepsy.
Significance
These models are likely to play a key role in the mechanistic interpretation of epileptiform activity.},

Transcranial electric stimulation with alternating currents (TACS) can manipulate these brain oscillations in a non-invasive manner. Recently, TACS using multiple electrodes with phase shifted stimulation currents were developed to alter long-range connectivity. Typically, an increase in coordination between two areas is assumed when they experience an in-phase stimulation and a disorganization through an anti-phase stimulation. However, the underlying biophysics of multi-electrode TACS has not been studied in detail. Here, we leverage direct invasive recordings from two non-human primates during multi-electrode TACS to characterize electric field magnitude and phase as a function of the phase of stimulation currents. Further, we report a novel “traveling wave” stimulation where the location of the electric field maximum changes over the stimulation cycle. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the biophysics of multi-electrode TACS and enable future developments of novel stimulation protocols.},

In addition, 40-Hz stimulation after stroke enhances interregional communication. These effects are observed up to 24 h after stimulation. Our stimulation protocol also rescues functional synaptic plasticity 24 h after stroke and leads to an upregulation of plasticity genes and a downregulation of cell death genes.

	abstract = {Direct current stimulation is a neuromodulatory noninvasive brain stimulation tool, which was first introduced in animal and human experiments in the 1950s, and added to the standard arsenal of methods to alter brain physiology as well as psychological, motor, and behavioral processes and clinical symptoms in neurological and psychiatric diseases about 20 years ago. In contrast to other noninvasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, it does not directly induce cerebral activity, but rather alters spontaneous brain activity and excitability by subthreshold modulation of neuronal membranes. Beyond acute effects on brain functions, specific protocols are suited to induce long-lasting alterations of cortical excitability and activity, which share features with long-term potentiation and depression. These neuroplastic processes are important foundations for various cognitive functions such as learning and memory formation and are pathologically altered in numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases. This explains the increasing interest to investigate transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a therapeutic tool. However, for tDCS to be used effectively, it is crucial to be informed about physiological mechanisms of action. These have been increasingly elucidated during the last years. This review gives an overview of the current knowledge available regarding physiological mechanisms of tDCS, spanning from acute regional effects, over neuroplastic effects to its impact on cerebral networks. Although knowledge about the physiological effects of tDCS is still not complete, this might help to guide applications on a scientifically sound foundation.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS: Applications of transcranial direct current stimulation to modulate human neuroplasticity have increased in research and clinical settings. However, the need for longer-lasting effects, combined with marked inter-individual variability, necessitates a deeper understanding of the relationship between stimulation parameters and physiological effects. We systematically investigated the full DC intensity range (0.5-2.0 mA) for both anodal and cathodal tDCS in a sham-controlled repeated measures design, monitoring changes in motor-cortical excitability via transcranial magnetic stimulation up to 2 h after stimulation. For both tDCS polarities, the excitability after-effects did not linearly correlate with increasing DC intensity; effects of lower intensities (0.5, 1.0 mA) showed equal, if not greater effects in motor-cortical excitability. Further, while intra-individual responses showed good reliability, inter-individual sensitivity to TMS accounted for a modest percentage of the variance in the early after-effects of 1.0 mA anodal tDCS, which may be of practical relevance for future optimizations.
ABSTRACT: Contemporary non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have shown promising potential in both restituting impairments in cortical physiology in clinical settings, as well as modulating cognitive abilities in the healthy population. However, neuroplastic after-effects of tDCS are highly dependent on stimulation parameters, relatively short lasting, and not expectedly uniform between individuals. The present study systematically investigates the full range of current intensity between 0.5 and 2.0 mA on left primary motor cortex (M1) plasticity, as well as the impact of individual-level covariates on explaining inter-individual variability. Thirty-eight healthy subjects were divided into groups of anodal and cathodal tDCS. Five DC intensities (sham, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mA) were investigated in separate sessions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 25 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded before, and 10 time points up to 2 h following 15 min of tDCS. Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated a main effect of intensity for both anodal and cathodal tDCS. With anodal tDCS, all active intensities resulted in equivalent facilitatory effects relative to sham while for cathodal tDCS, only 1.0 mA resulted in sustained excitability diminution. An additional experiment conducted to assess intra-individual variability revealed generally good reliability of 1.0 mA anodal tDCS (ICC(2,1) = 0.74 over the first 30 min). A post hoc analysis to discern sources of inter-individual variability confirmed a previous finding in which individual TMS SI1mV (stimulus intensity for 1 mV MEP amplitude) sensitivity correlated negatively with 1.0 mA anodal tDCS effects on excitability. Our study thus provides further insights on the extent of non-linear intensity-dependent neuroplastic after-effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cathodal direct current stimulation (cDCS) induces long-term depression (LTD)-like reduction of cortical excitability (DCS-LTD), which has been tested in the treatment of epilepsy with modest effects. In part, this may be due to variable cortical neuron orientation relative to the electric field. We tested, in vivo and in vitro, whether DCS-LTD occurs throughout the cortical thickness, and if not, then whether drug-DCS pairing can enhance the uniformity of the cortical response and the cDCS antiepileptic effect.
METHODS: cDCS-mediated changes in cortical excitability were measured in vitro in mouse motor cortex (M1) and in human postoperative neocortex, in vivo in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), and in a mouse kainic acid (KA)-seizure model. Contributions of N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) to cDCS-mediated plasticity were tested with application of NMDAR blockers (memantine/D-AP5).
RESULTS: cDCS reliably induced DCS-LTD in superficial cortical layers, and a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like enhancement (DCS-LTP) was recorded in deep cortical layers. Immunostaining confirmed layer-specific increase of phospho-S6 ribosomal protein in mouse M1. Similar nonuniform cDCS aftereffects on cortical excitability were also found in human neocortex in vitro and in S1 of alert mice in vivo. Application of memantine/D-AP5 either produced a more uniform DCS-LTD throughout the cortical thickness or at least abolished DCS-LTP. Moreover, a combination of memantine and cDCS suppressed KA-induced seizures.
INTERPRETATION: cDCS aftereffects are not uniform throughout cortical layers, which may explain the incomplete cDCS clinical efficacy. NMDAR antagonists may augment cDCS efficacy in epilepsy and other disorders where regional depression of cortical excitability is desirable. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:489-502.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: tDCS modulates cortical plasticity and has shown potential to improve cognitive/motor functions in healthy young humans. However, age-related alterations of brain structure and functions might require an adaptation of tDCS-parameters to achieve a targeted plasticity effect in older humans and conclusions obtained from young adults might not be directly transferable to older adults. Thus, our study aimed to systematically explore the association between tDCS-parameters and induced aftereffects on motor cortical excitability to determine optimal stimulation protocols for older individuals, as well as to investigate age-related differences of motor cortex plasticity in two different age groups of older adults.
METHODS: 32 healthy, volunteers from two different age groups of Young-Old (50-65 years, n = 16) and Old-Old (66-80 years, n = 16) participated in this study. Anodal tDCS was applied over the primary motor cortex, with respective combinations of three intensities (1, 2, and 3 mA) and durations (15, 20, and 30 min), in a sham-controlled cross-over design. Cortical excitability alterations were monitored by single-pulse TMS-induced MEPs until the next day morning after stimulation.
RESULTS: All active stimulation conditions resulted in a significant enhancement of motor cortical excitability in both age groups. The facilitatory aftereffects of anodal tDCS did not significantly differ between age groups. We observed prolonged plasticity in the late-phase range for two protocols with the highest stimulation intensity (i.e., 3 mA-20 min, 3 mA-30 min).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the role of stimulation dosage in tDCS-induced neuroplastic aftereffects in the motor cortex of healthy older adults and delivers crucial information about optimized tDCS protocols in the domain of the primary motor cortex. Our findings might set the grounds for the development of optimal stimulation protocols to reinstate neuroplasticity in different cortical areas and induce long-lasting, functionally relevant plasticity in normal aging and in pathological conditions, which would require however systematic tDCS titration studies over respective target areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has wide ranging applications in neuro-behavioural and physiological research, and in neurological rehabilitation. However, it is currently limited by substantial inter-subject variability in responses, which may be explained, at least in part, by anatomical differences that lead to variability in the electric field (E-field) induced in the cortex. Here, we tested whether the variability in the E-field in the stimulated cortex during anodal tDCS, estimated using computational simulations, explains the variability in tDCS induced changes in GABA, a neurophysiological marker of stimulation effect.
METHODS: Data from five previously conducted MRS studies were combined. The anode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1, 3 studies, N = 24) or right temporal cortex (2 studies, N = 32), with the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital ridge. Single voxel spectroscopy was performed in a 2x2x2cm voxel under the anode in all cases. MRS data were acquired before and either during or after 1 mA tDCS using either a sLASER sequence (7T) or a MEGA-PRESS sequence (3T). sLASER MRS data were analysed using LCModel, and MEGA-PRESS using FID-A and Gannet. E-fields were simulated in a finite element model of the head, based on individual structural MR images, using SimNIBS. Separate linear mixed effects models were run for each E-field variable (mean and 95th percentile; magnitude, and components normal and tangential to grey matter surface, within the MRS voxel). The model included effects of time (pre or post tDCS), E-field, grey matter volume in the MRS voxel, and a 3-way interaction between time, E-field and grey matter volume. Additionally, we ran a permutation analysis using PALM to determine whether E-field anywhere in the brain, not just in the MRS voxel, correlated with GABA change.
RESULTS: In M1, higher mean E-field magnitude was associated with greater anodal tDCS-induced decreases in GABA (t(24) = 3.24, p = 0.003). Further, the association between mean E-field magnitude and GABA change was moderated by the grey matter volume in the MRS voxel (t(24) = -3.55, p = 0.002). These relationships were consistent across all E-field variables except the mean of the normal component. No significant relationship was found between tDCS-induced GABA decrease and E-field in the temporal voxel. No significant clusters were found in the whole brain analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the electric field induced by tDCS within the brain is variable, and is significantly related to anodal tDCS-induced decrease in GABA, a key neurophysiological marker of stimulation. These findings strongly support individualised dosing of tDCS, at least in M1. Further studies examining E-fields in relation to other outcome measures, including behaviour, will help determine the optimal E-fields required for any desired effects.},

In recent years, MRS has increasingly been utilised as a method to indirectly assess neuronal activity in vivo, primarily via measurement of the major neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). To date a number of studies have highlighted relationships between local GABA levels and behaviour, and have demonstrated the modulation of GABA by protocols designed to induce synaptic plasticity. This review aims to examine the literature on MRS-assessed GABA changes in synaptic plasticity, focussing on the primary motor cortex (M1), to relate these to animal studies on the role of GABA in synaptic plasticity, and to highlight some of the important outstanding questions in interpreting MRS findings.},

Recently, however, externally applied EFs have been shown to modulate pharmacologically evoked network activity in rodent hippocampus. In contrast, very little is known about the role of endogenous EFs during physiological activity states in neocortex. Here we used the neocortical slow oscillation in vitro as a model system to show that weak sinusoidal and naturalistic EFs enhance and entrain physiological neocortical network activity with an amplitude threshold within the range of in vivo endogenous field strengths. Modulation of network activity by positive and negative feedback fields based on the network activity in real-time provide direct evidence for a feedback loop between neuronal activity and endogenous EF. This significant susceptibility of active networks to EFs that only cause small changes in membrane potential in individual neurons suggests that endogenous EFs could guide neocortical network activity.},

For that purpose, we set out to derive EEG patterns based on a spatio-spectral decomposition of band-limited EEG power in the source-reconstructed space. On a large data set of 72 subjects resting-state hdEEG-fMRI we showed that the proposed approach is reliable both in terms of the extracted patterns as well as their spatial BOLD signatures. The five most robust EEG spatio-spectral patterns include, but go beyond, the well-known occipital alpha power dynamics. The EEG spatial-spectral patterns show relatively weak, yet statistically significant spatial similarity to their fMRI BOLD signatures, particularly the patterns that show stronger temporal synchronization with BOLD. However, we observed an insignificant relation between the temporal synchronization and spatial overlap of the EEG spatio-spectral patterns and the classical fMRI BOLD resting state networks (as obtained by independent component analysis). This provides evidence that both EEG (frequency-specific) power and BOLD signal capture reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of neural dynamics. Rather than being mutually redundant, these are only partially overlapping, carrying to a large extent complementary information concerning the underlying low-frequency dynamics. Finally, we report and interpret the most stable source space EEG-fMRI patterns, along with the corresponding EEG electrode space patterns better known from the literature.},

A potential solution lies in the non-local, distributed computation at the whole-brain level made possible by criticality and amplified by the rare long-range connections found in the brain’s unique anatomical structure. This non-locality can be captured by the mathematical structure of Schrödinger’s wave equation, which is at the heart of the novel CHARM (Complex Harmonics decomposition) framework that performs the necessary dimensional manifold reduction able to extract non-locality in critical spacetime brain dynamics. Using a large neuroimaging dataset of over 1,000 people, CHARM captured the critical, non-local/long-range nature of brain dynamics and the underlying mechanisms were established using a precise whole-brain model. Equally, CHARM revealed the significantly different critical dynamics of wakefulness and sleep. Overall, CHARM is a promising theoretical framework for capturing the low-dimensionality of the complex network dynamics observed in neuroscience and provides evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of critical brain dynamics.},

	abstract = {Humans use similar brain systems to both imagine and perceive. While the re-use of brain systems specialised for sensory perception for offline simulation is an efficient use of resources, it also leads to a potential for confusions between imagination and reality. It remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination. Here we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by a latent variable that encodes the combined strength of sensory signals generated by either imagery or perception. We use functional magnetic resonance imagining to reveal that this latent variable is tracked by the activity of bilateral fusiform gyrus and predicts confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis. We further characterise interactions between fusiform gyrus and a network of prefrontal regions encoding binary judgments of reality, in line with higher-order theories of reality monitoring. Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring fluctuations in the activity of mid-level sensory cortex. These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing such as hallucinations and lay the foundations for characterising a generalised reality monitoring system in the human brain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been extensively studied over the past 20 years to promote functional motor recovery after stroke. However, tDCS clinical relevance still needs to be determined. The present systematic review aims to determine whether tDCS applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) in stroke patients can have a positive effect on functional motor outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two databases (Medline \& Scopus) were searched for randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled trials pertaining to the use of M1 tDCS on cerebral stroke patients, and its effects on validated functional motor outcomes. When data were provided, effect sizes were calculated. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018108157.
RESULTS: 46 studies (n = 1291 patients) met inclusion criteria. Overall study quality was good (7.69/10 on the PEDro scale). Over half (56.5\%) the studies were on chronic stroke patients. There seemed to be a certain pattern of recurring parameters, but tDCS protocols still remain heterogeneous. Overall results were positive (71.7\% of studies found that tDCS has positive results on functional motor outcomes). Effect-sizes ranged from 0 to 1.33. No severe adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Despite heterogeneous stimulation parameters, outcomes and patient demographics, tDCS seems to be complementary to classical and novel rehabilitation approaches. With minimal adverse effects (if screening parameters are respected), none of which were serious, and a high potential to improve recovery when using optimal parameters (i.e.: 20 min of stimulation, at 2 mA with 25 or 35cm2 electrodes that are regularly humidified), tDCS could potentially be ready for clinical applications.Implications for RehabilitationtDCS could potentially be ready for clinical application.Evidence of very low to very high quality is available on the effectiveness of tDCS to improve motor control following stroke.This should with caution be focused on the primary motor cortex.},

	abstract = {Perception is shaped by both incoming sensory input and expectations derived from our prior knowledge. Numerous studies have shown stronger neural activity for surprising inputs, suggestive of predictive processing. However, it is largely unclear what predictions are made across the cortical hierarchy, and therefore what kind of surprise drives this up-regulation of activity. Here, we leveraged fMRI in human volunteers and deep neural network (DNN) models to arbitrate between 2 hypotheses: prediction errors may signal a local mismatch between input and expectation at each level of the cortical hierarchy, or prediction errors may be computed at higher levels and the resulting surprise signal is broadcast to earlier areas in the cortical hierarchy. Our results align with the latter hypothesis. Prediction errors in both low- and high-level visual cortex responded to high-level, but not low-level, visual surprise. This scaling with high-level surprise in early visual cortex strongly diverged from feedforward tuning. Combined, our results suggest that high-level predictions constrain sensory processing in earlier areas, thereby aiding perceptual inference.},

We investigated whether these interareal influences are subserved differentially by rhythmic synchronization. We correlated frequency-specific directed influences among 28 pairs of visual areas with anatomical metrics of the feedforward or feedback character of the respective interareal projections. This revealed that in the primate visual system, feedforward influences are carried by theta-band (∼ 4 Hz) and gamma-band (∼ 60-80 Hz) synchronization, and feedback influences by beta-band (∼ 14-18 Hz) synchronization. The functional directed influences constrain a functional hierarchy similar to the anatomical hierarchy, but exhibiting task-dependent dynamic changes in particular with regard to the hierarchical positions of frontal areas. Our results demonstrate that feedforward and feedback signaling use distinct frequency channels, suggesting that they subserve differential communication requirements.},

	abstract = {A major goal of neuroscience, statistical physics, and nonlinear dynamics is to understand how brain function arises from the collective dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. This challenge has been chiefly addressed through large-scale numerical simulations. Alternatively, researchers have formulated mean-field theories to gain insight into macroscopic states of large neuronal networks in terms of the collective firing activity of the neurons, or the firing rate. However, these theories have not succeeded in establishing an exact correspondence between the firing rate of the network and the underlying microscopic state of the spiking neurons. This has largely constrained the range of applicability of such macroscopic descriptions, particularly when trying to describe neuronal synchronization. Here, we provide the derivation of a set of exact macroscopic equations for a network of spiking neurons. Our results reveal that the spike generation mechanism of individual neurons introduces an effective coupling between two biophysically relevant macroscopic quantities, the firing rate and the mean membrane potential, which together govern the evolution of the neuronal network. The resulting equations exactly describe all possible macroscopic dynamical states of the network, including states of synchronous spiking activity. Finally, we show that the firing-rate description is related, via a conformal map, to a low-dimensional description in terms of the Kuramoto order parameter, called Ott-Antonsen theory. We anticipate that our results will be an important tool in investigating how large networks of spiking neurons self-organize in time to process and encode information in the brain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We implemented computational models of human and rat cortical neurons for simulating the neural response to cortical stimulation with electromagnetic fields.
APPROACH: We adapted model neurons from the library of Blue Brain models to reflect biophysical and geometric properties of both adult rat and human cortical neurons and coupled the model neurons to exogenous electric fields (E-fields). The models included 3D reconstructed axonal and dendritic arbors, experimentally-validated electrophysiological behaviors, and multiple, morphological variants within cell types. Using these models, we characterized the single-cell responses to intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) and uniform E-field with dc as well as pulsed currents.
MAIN RESULTS: The strength-duration and current-distance characteristics of the model neurons to ICMS agreed with published experimental results, as did the subthreshold polarization of cell bodies and axon terminals by uniform dc E-fields. For all forms of stimulation, the lowest threshold elements were terminals of the axon collaterals, and the dependence of threshold and polarization on spatial and temporal stimulation parameters was strongly affected by morphological features of the axonal arbor, including myelination, diameter, and branching.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide key insights into the mechanisms of cortical stimulation. The presented models can be used to study various cortical stimulation modalities while incorporating detailed spatial and temporal features of the applied E-field.},

	abstract = {Neural mass models such as the Jansen-Rit or Wendling systems provide a practical framework for representing and interpreting electro-physiological activity (1–6) in both local and global brain models (7, 8). However, they are only partly derived from first principles. While the post-synaptic potential dynamics are inferred from data and can be grounded on diffusion physics (9–11), Freeman’s “wave to pulse” (W2P) sigmoid function (12–14), used to transduce mean population membrane potential into firing rate, rests on a weaker theoretical standing. On the other hand, Montbrió et al (15, 16) derive an exact mean-field theory (MPR) from a quadratic integrate and fire neuron model under some simplifying assumptions, thereby connecting microscale neural mechanisms and meso/macroscopic phenomena. The MPR model can be seen to replace Freeman’s W2P sigmoid function with a pair of differential equations for the mean membrane potential and firing rate variables—a dynamical relation between firing rate and membrane potential—, providing a more fundamental interpretation of the semi-empirical NMM sigmoid parameters. In doing so, we show it sheds light on the mechanisms behind enhanced network response to weak but uniform perturbations. In the exact mean-field theory, intrinsic population connectivity modulates the steady-state firing rate W2P relation in a monotonic manner, with increasing self-connectivity leading to higher firing rates. This provides a plausible mechanism for the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak, uniform inputs such as the electric fields produced by non-invasive brain stimulation. This new, dynamic W2P relation also endows the neural mass model with a form of “inertia”, an intrinsic delay to external inputs that depends on, e.g., self-coupling strength and state of the system. Next, we complete the MPR model by adding the second-order equations for delayed post-synaptic currents and the coupling term with an external electric field, bringing together the MPR and the usual NMM formalisms into a unified exact mean-field theory (NMM2) displaying rich dynamical features. In the single population model, we show that the resonant sensitivity to weak alternating electric field is enhanced by increased self-connectivity and slow synapses.
SignificanceSeveral decades of research suggest that weak electric fields influence neural processing. A long-standing question in the field is how networks of neurons process spatially uniform weak inputs that barely affect a single neuron but that produce measurable effects in networks. Answering this can help implement electric field coupling mechanisms in neural mass models of the whole brain, and better represent the impact of electrical stimulation or ephaptic communication. This issue can be studied using local detailed computational models, but the use of statistical mechanics methods can deliver “mean-field models” to simplify the analysis. Following the steps of Montbrió et al (15, 16), we show that the sensitivity to inputs such a weak alternating electric field can be modulated by the intrinsic self-connectivity of a neural population, and produce a more grounded set of equations for neural mass modeling to guide further work.},

However, the relationship between those mathematical models and the physics of the measurements is unclear. In addition, it is challenging to represent SEEG data by combining NMMs and volume conductor models due to the intermediate spatial scale represented by these measurements.Approach.We provide a framework combining the multi-compartmental modeling formalism and a detailed geometrical model to simulate the transmembrane currents that appear in layer 3, 5 and 6 pyramidal cells due to a synaptic input. With this approach, it is possible to realistically simulate the current source density (CSD) depth profile inside a cortical patch due to inputs localized into a single cortical layer and the induced voltage measured by two SEEG contacts using a volume conductor model. Based on this approach, we built a framework to connect the activity of a NMM with a volume conductor model and we simulated an example of SEEG signal as a proof of concept.Main results.CSD depends strongly on the distribution of the synaptic inputs onto the different cortical layers and the equivalent current dipole strengths display substantial differences (of up to a factor of four in magnitude in our example). Thus, the inputs coming from different neural populations do not contribute equally to the electrophysiological recordings. A direct consequence of this is that the raw output of NMMs is not a good proxy for electrical recordings. We also show that the simplest CSD model that can accurately reproduce SEEG measurements can be constructed from discrete monopolar sources (one per cortical layer).Significance.Our results highlight the importance of including a physical model in NMMs to represent measurements. We provide a framework connecting microscale neuron models with the neural mass formalism and with physical models of the measurement process that can improve the accuracy of predicted electrophysiological recordings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) signals are routinely recorded to identify the epileptogenic zone network (EZN). This network consists of remote brain regions involved in seizure initiation. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying typical SEEG patterns that occur during the transition from interictal to ictal activity in distant brain nodes of the EZN remain poorly understood. The primary aim is to identify and explain these mechanisms using a novel physiologically-plausible model of the EZN.
METHODS: We analyzed SEEG signals recorded from the EZN in 10 patients during the transition from interictal to ictal activity. This transition consisted of a sequence of periods during which SEEG signals from distant neocortical regions showed stereotypical patterns of activity: sustained preictal spiking activity preceding a fast activity occurring at seizure onset, followed by the ictal activity. Spectral content and non-linear correlation of SEEG signals were analyzed. In addition, we developed a novel neuro-inspired computational model consisting of bidirectionally coupled neuronal populations.
RESULTS: The proposed model captured the essential characteristics of the patient signals, including the quasi-synchronous onset of rapid discharges in distant interconnected epileptogenic zones. Statistical analysis confirmed the dynamic correlation/de-decorrelation pattern observed in the patient signals and accurately reproduced in the simulated signals.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insight into the abnormal dynamic changes in glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synaptic transmission that occur during the transition to seizures. The results strongly support the hypothesis that bidirectional connections between distant neuronal populations of the EZN (from pyramidal cells to vaso-intestinal peptide-positive interneurons) play a key role in this transition, while parvalbumin-positive interneurons intervene in the emergence of rapid discharges at seizure onset.},

Yet, a direct examination of how tACS interacts with neuronal spiking activity that gives rise to the alpha oscillation in the thalamo-cortical system has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate how tACS entrains endogenous alpha oscillations in head-fixed awake ferrets. We first show that endogenous alpha oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex drive the primary visual cortex and the higher-order visual thalamus. Spike-field coherence is largest for the alpha frequency band, and presumed fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons exhibit strongest coupling to this oscillation. We then apply alpha-tACS that results in a field strength comparable to what is commonly used in humans ({\textless}0.5 mV/mm). Both in these ferret experiments and in a computational model of the thalamo-cortical system, tACS entrains alpha oscillations by following the theoretically predicted Arnold tongue. Intriguingly, the fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons exhibit a stronger entrainment response to tACS in both the ferret experiments and the computational model, likely due to their stronger endogenous coupling to the alpha oscillation. Our findings demonstrate the in vivo mechanism of action for the modulation of the alpha oscillation by tACS.},

	abstract = {Neural oscillations are a key mechanism for information transfer in brain circuits. Rhythmic fluctuations of local field potentials control spike timing through cyclic membrane de- and hyperpolarization. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation method which can directly interact with brain oscillatory activity by imposing an oscillating electric field on neurons. Despite its increasing use, the basic mechanisms of tACS are still not fully understood. Here, we investigate in a computational study the effects of tACS on morphologically realistic neurons with ongoing spiking activity. We characterize the membrane polarization as a function of electric field strength and subsequent effects on spiking activity in a set of 25 neurons from different neocortical layers. We find that tACS does not affect the firing rate of investigated neurons for electric field strengths applicable to human studies. However, we find that the applied electric fields entrain the spiking activity of large pyramidal neurons and large basket neurons at {\textless} 1 mV/mm field strengths. Our model results are in line with recent experimental studies and can provide a mechanistic framework to understand the effects of oscillating electric fields on single neuron activity.

Multichannel data from {\textasciitilde} 3 min recordings was converted to spectrograms and their algorithmic complexity estimated using Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression. Complexity measures and entropy rate displayed statistically significant differences between groups. Results are compared to those using the ratio of slow to fast frequency power, which they are seen to complement by displaying increased sensitivity even when using a few EEG channels. Poor prognosis in RBD appears to be associated with decreased complexity of EEG spectrograms stemming in part from frequency power imbalances and cross-frequency amplitude algorithmic coupling. Algorithmic complexity metrics provide a robust, powerful and complementary way to quantify the dynamics of EEG signals in RBD with links to emerging theories of brain function stemming from algorithmic information theory.},

	abstract = {Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, there currently exists no formal definition for it that is measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. Our definition has the potential to inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought.},

	abstract = {The goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved.

Psychedelics have been used by indigenous cultures for millennia [1]; however, because of LSD's unique potency and the timing of its discovery (coinciding with a period of major discovery in psychopharmacology), it is generally regarded as the quintessential contemporary psychedelic [2]. LSD has profound modulatory effects on consciousness and was used extensively in psychological research and psychiatric practice in the 1950s and 1960s [3]. In spite of this, however, there have been no modern human imaging studies of its acute effects on the brain. Here we studied the effects of LSD on intrinsic functional connectivity within the human brain using fMRI. High-level association cortices (partially overlapping with the default-mode, salience, and frontoparietal attention networks) and the thalamus showed increased global connectivity under the drug. The cortical areas showing increased global connectivity overlapped significantly with a map of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor densities (the key site of action of psychedelic drugs [4]). LSD also increased global integration by inflating the level of communication between normally distinct brain networks. The increase in global connectivity observed under LSD correlated with subjective reports of "ego dissolution." The present results provide the first evidence that LSD selectively expands global connectivity in the brain, compromising the brain's modular and "rich-club" organization and, simultaneously, the perceptual boundaries between the self and the environment.},

However, the neural mechanisms mediating its effects require in-depth investigation as there is still much to learn about how psychedelic drugs produce their profound and long-lasting effects. In this review, we outline the current understanding of the neurophysiology of psilocybin’s psychoactive properties, highlighting the need for additional preclinical studies to determine its effect on neural network dynamics. We first describe how psilocybin’s effect on brain regions associated with the default-mode network (DMN), particularly the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, likely plays a key role in mediating its consciousness-altering properties. We then outline the specific receptor and cell types involved and discuss contradictory evidence from neuroimaging studies regarding psilocybin’s net effect on activity within these regions. We go on to argue that in vivo electrophysiology is ideally suited to provide a more holistic, neural network analysis approach to understand psilocybin’s mode of action. Thus, we integrate information about the neural bases for oscillatory activity generation with the accumulating evidence about psychedelic drug effects on neural synchrony within DMN-associated areas. This approach will help to generate important questions for future preclinical and clinical studies. Answers to these questions are vital for determining the neural mechanisms mediating psilocybin’s psychotherapeutic potential, which promises to improve outcomes for patients with severe depression and other difficulty to treat conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Electrophysiologic measures provide an opportunity to inform mechanistic models and possibly biomarker prediction of response. Serotonergic psychedelics (SPs) (i.e., psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) and ketamine represent new investigational and established treatments in mood disorders respectively. There is a need to better characterize the mechanism of action of these agents.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review investigating the spectral signatures of psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine in persons with major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and healthy controls.
Results
Ketamine and SPs are associated with increased theta power in persons with depression. Ketamine and SPs are also associated with decreased spectral power in the alpha, beta and delta bands in healthy controls and persons with depression. When administered with SPs, theta power was increased in persons with MDD when administered with SPs. Ketamine is associated with increased gamma band power in both healthy controls and persons with MDD.
Limitations
The studies included in our review were heterogeneous in their patient population, exposure, dosing of treatment and devices used to evaluate EEG and MEG signatures. Our results were extracted entirely from persons who were either healthy volunteers or persons with MDD or TRD.
Conclusions
Extant literature evaluating EEG and MEG spectral signatures indicate that ketamine and SPs have reproducible effects in keeping with disease models of network connectivity. Future research vistas should evaluate whether observed spectral signatures can guide further discovery of therapeutics within the psychedelic and dissociative classes of agents, and its prediction capability in persons treated for depression.},

	abstract = {Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 μg/kg vs placebo) on both α oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital α power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced α power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of α oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.},

We studied human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, which simulate key aspects of AD. Electroencephalographic recordings in hAPP mice revealed spontaneous epileptiform discharges, indicating network hypersynchrony, primarily during reduced gamma oscillatory activity. Because this oscillatory rhythm is generated by inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) cells, network dysfunction in hAPP mice might arise from impaired PV cells. Supporting this hypothesis, hAPP mice and AD patients had decreased levels of the interneuron-specific and PV cell-predominant voltage-gated sodium channel subunit Nav1.1. Restoring Nav1.1 levels in hAPP mice by Nav1.1-BAC expression increased inhibitory synaptic activity and gamma oscillations and reduced hypersynchrony, memory deficits, and premature mortality. We conclude that reduced Nav1.1 levels and PV cell dysfunction critically contribute to abnormalities in oscillatory rhythms, network synchrony, and memory in hAPP mice and possibly in AD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background
The neural activity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) is disrupted in patients with In Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Objectives
We used a novel multimodal approach to track neural signal propagation within the DMN in AD patients.
Methods
Twenty mild to moderate AD patients were recruited. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses to probe with a millisecond time resolution the propagation of evoked electroencephalography (EEG) signal following the neural activation of the Precuneus (PC), which is a key hub area of the DMN. Moreover, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected to reconstruct individual features of the DMN.
Results
In AD patients a probe TMS pulse applied over the PC evokes an increased local activity unmasking underlying hyperexcitability. In contrast, the EEG evoked neural signal did not propagate efficiently within the DMN showing a remarkable breakdown of signal propagation. fMRI and structural tractography showed that impaired signal propagation was related to the same connectivity matrices derived from DMN BOLD signal and transferred by specific white matter bundles forming the cingulum. These features were not detectable stimulating other areas (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or for different networks (fronto-parietal network). Finally, connectivity breakdown was associated with cognitive impairment, as measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB).
Conclusions
TMS-EEG in AD shows both local hyperexcitability and a lack of signal propagation within the DMN. These neurophysiological features also correlate with structural and cognitive attributes of the patients.
Significance
Neuronavigated TMS-EEG may be used as a novel neurophysiological biomarker of DMN connectivity in AD patients.},

The synchronous firing of neurons in the gamma-band has been proposed to bind multiple features of an object, which are coded in a distributed manner in the brain, and is modulated by cognitive processes such as attention and memory. In certain neuropsychiatric disorders the gamma activity shows significant changes. In schizophrenic patients, negative symptoms correlate with a decrease of gamma responses, whereas a significant increase in gamma amplitudes is observed during positive symptoms such as hallucinations. A reduction is also observed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), whereas an increase is found in epileptic patients, probably reflecting both cortical excitation and perceptual distortions such as déjà vu phenomena frequently observed in epilepsy. ADHD patients also exhibit increased gamma amplitudes. A hypothesis of a gamma axis of these disorders mainly based on the significance of gamma oscillations for memory matching is formulated.},

Additionally, animal models have shown an important role for 5-HT2AR agonists in modulating learning and memory function with relevance for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias.

This paper reviews evidence for effectiveness of natural and synthetic psychedelics in the treatment of AD causes and symptoms. The plastogenic effects of serotonergic psychedelics illustrate that they have efficacy for addressing multiple facets of AD pathology. We review findings illustrating neuroplasticity mechanisms of classic (serotonergic) and non-classic psychedelics that indicate their potential as treatments for AD and related dementias. Classic psychedelics modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission and stimulate synaptic and network remodeling that facilitates synaptic, structural and behavioral plasticity. Up-regulation of neurotrophic factors enable psychedelics to promote neuronal survival and glutamate-driven neuroplasticity. Muscimol modulation of GABAAR reduces Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and psychedelic Sig-1R agonists provide protective roles in Aβ toxicity. Classic psychedelics also activate mTOR intracellular effector pathways in brain regions that show atrophy in AD. The potential of psychedelics to treat AD involves their ability to induce structural and functional neural plasticity in brain circuits and slow or reverse brain atrophy. Psychedelics stimulate neurotrophic pathways, increase neurogenesis and produce long-lasting neural changes through rewiring pathological neurocircuitry. Psychedelic effects on 5-HT receptor target genes and induction of synaptic, structural, and functional changes in neurons and networks enable them to promote and enhance brain functional connectivity and address diverse mechanisms underlying degenerative neurological disorders. These findings provide a rationale for immediate investigation of psychedelics as treatments for AD patients.},

However, their detailed interactions with the electrophysiological changes at the meso- and macroscale are not yet fully understood. We developed a mechanistic multiscale model of AD progression, linking proteinopathy to its effects on neural activity and vice-versa. We integrated a heterodimer model of prion-like protein propagation and a brain network model of Jansen–Rit neural masses derived from human neuroimaging data whose parameters varied due to neurotoxicity. Results showed that changes in inhibition guided the electrophysiological alterations found in AD, and these changes were mainly attributed to Aβ effects. Additionally, we found a causal disconnection between cellular hyperactivity and interregional hypersynchrony contrary to previous beliefs. Finally, we demonstrated that early Aβ and hp-tau depositions’ location determine the spatiotemporal profile of the proteinopathy. The presented model combines the molecular effects of both Aβ and hp-tau together with a mechanistic protein propagation model and network effects within a closed-loop model. This holds the potential to enlighten the interplay between AD mechanisms on various scales, aiming to develop and test novel hypotheses on the contribution of different AD-related variables to the disease evolution.},

	abstract = {Background
Antidepressant medication and running therapy are both effective treatments for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. However, they may work through different pathophysiological mechanisms and could differ in their impact on physical health. This study examined effects of antidepressants versus running therapy on both mental and physical health.
Methods
According to a partially randomized patient preference design, 141 patients with depression and/or anxiety disorder were randomized or offered preferred 16-week treatment: antidepressant medication (escitalopram or sertraline) or group-based running therapy ≥2 per week. Baseline (T0) and post-treatment assessment at week 16 (T16) included mental (diagnosis status and symptom severity) and physical health indicators (metabolic and immune indicators, heart rate (variability), weight, lung function, hand grip strength, fitness).
Results
Of the 141 participants (mean age 38.2 years; 58.2 \% female), 45 participants received antidepressant medication and 96 underwent running therapy. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that remission rates at T16 were comparable (antidepressants: 44.8 \%; running: 43.3 \%; p = .881). However, the groups differed significantly on various changes in physical health: weight (d = 0.57; p = .001), waist circumference (d = 0.44; p = .011), systolic (d = 0.45; p = .011) and diastolic (d = 0.53; p = .002) blood pressure, heart rate (d = 0.36; p = .033) and heart rate variability (d = 0.48; p = .006).
Limitations
A minority of the participants was willing to be randomized; the running therapy was larger due to greater preference for this intervention.
Conclusions
While the interventions had comparable effects on mental health, running therapy outperformed antidepressants on physical health, due to both larger improvements in the running therapy group as well as larger deterioration in the antidepressant group.

	abstract = {How humans solve the cocktail party problem remains unknown. However, progress has been made recently thanks to the realization that cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of speech. This has led to the development of regression methods for studying the neurophysiology of continuous speech. One such method, known as stimulus-reconstruction, has been successfully utilized with cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the former is invasive and gives a relatively restricted view of processing along the auditory hierarchy, whereas the latter is expensive and rare. Thus it would be extremely useful for research in many populations if stimulus-reconstruction was effective using electroencephalography (EEG), a widely available and inexpensive technology. Here we show that single-trial (≈60 s) unaveraged EEG data can be decoded to determine attentional selection in a naturalistic multispeaker environment. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between our EEG-based measure of attention and performance on a high-level attention task. In addition, by attempting to decode attention at individual latencies, we identify neural processing at ∼200 ms as being critical for solving the cocktail party problem. These findings open up new avenues for studying the ongoing dynamics of cognition using EEG and for developing effective and natural brain-computer interfaces.},

	abstract = {The cortical representation of the acoustic features of continuous speech is the foundation of speech perception. In this study, noninvasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings are obtained from human subjects actively listening to spoken narratives, in both simple and cocktail party-like auditory scenes. By modeling how acoustic features of speech are encoded in ongoing MEG activity as a spectrotemporal response function, we demonstrate that the slow temporal modulations of speech in a broad spectral region are represented bilaterally in auditory cortex by a phase-locked temporal code. For speech presented monaurally to either ear, this phase-locked response is always more faithful in the right hemisphere, but with a shorter latency in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. When different spoken narratives are presented to each ear simultaneously (dichotic listening), the resulting cortical neural activity precisely encodes the acoustic features of both of the spoken narratives, but slightly weakened and delayed compared with the monaural response. Critically, the early sensory response to the attended speech is considerably stronger than that to the unattended speech, demonstrating top-down attentional gain control. This attentional gain is substantial even during the subjects' very first exposure to the speech mixture and therefore largely independent of knowledge of the speech content. Together, these findings characterize how the spectrotemporal features of speech are encoded in human auditory cortex and establish a single-trial-based paradigm to study the neural basis underlying the cocktail party phenomenon.},

However, by analyzing simulated and actual LFPs, here we question the existence of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rat hippocampus. We show that the quasi-linear phase shifts introduced by filtering lead to spurious coupling levels in both white noise and hippocampal LFPs, which highly depend on epoch length, and that significant coupling may be falsely detected when employing improper surrogate methods. We also show that waveform asymmetry and frequency harmonics may generate artifactual n:m phase-locking. Studies investigating phase-phase coupling should rely on appropriate statistical controls and be aware of confounding factors; otherwise, they could easily fall into analysis pitfalls.},

Much less is known about humans’ ability to deploy such alpha lateralization in time, and to thus exploit alpha power as a spatio-temporal filter. Here we show that spatially lateralized alpha power does signify – beyond the direction of spatial attention – the distribution of attention in time and thereby qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter. Participants (N = 20) selectively listened to spoken numbers presented on one side (left vs right), while competing numbers were presented on the other side. Key to our hypothesis, temporal foreknowledge was manipulated via a visual cue, which was either instructive and indicated the to-be-probed number position (70\% valid) or neutral. Temporal foreknowledge did guide participants’ attention, as they recognized numbers from the to-be-attended side more accurately following valid cues. In the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spatial attention to the left versus right side induced lateralization of alpha power in all temporal cueing conditions. Modulation of alpha lateralization at the 0.8 Hz presentation rate of spoken numbers was stronger following instructive compared to neutral temporal cues. Critically, we found stronger modulation of lateralized alpha power specifically at the onsets of temporally cued numbers. These results suggest that the precisely timed hemispheric lateralization of alpha power qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter mechanism susceptible to top-down behavioural goals.},

Here, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to study how a mixture of two speech streams is represented in the brain as subjects attend to one stream or the other. To characterize the speech-EEG relationships and how they are modulated by attention, we estimate the statistical association between each canonical EEG frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low-gamma, and high-gamma) and the envelope of each of ten different frequency bands in the input speech. Consistent with previous literature, we find that low-frequency (delta and theta) bands show greater speech-EEG coherence when the speech stream is attended compared to when it is ignored. We also find that the envelope of the low-gamma band shows a similar attention effect, a result not previously reported with EEG. This is consistent with the prevailing theory that neural dynamics in the gamma range are important for attention-dependent routing of information in cortical circuits. In addition, we also find that the greatest attention-dependent increases in speech-EEG coherence are seen in the mid-frequency acoustic bands (0.5–3 kHz) of input speech and the temporal-parietal EEG sensors. Finally, we find individual differences in the following: (1) the specific set of speech-EEG associations that are the strongest, (2) the EEG and speech features that are the most informative about attentional focus, and (3) the overall magnitude of attentional enhancement of speech-EEG coherence.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) could experience neural entrainment to individualized music, which explored the cross-modal influences of music on patients with DoC through phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Furthermore, the study assessed the efficacy of individualized music or preferred music (PM) versus relaxing music (RM) in impacting patient outcomes, and examined the role of cross-modal influences in determining these outcomes.
METHODS: Thirty-two patients with DoC [17 with vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) and 15 with minimally conscious state (MCS)], alongside 16 healthy controls (HCs), were recruited for this study. Neural activities in the frontal-parietal network were recorded using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during baseline (BL), RM and PM. Cerebral-acoustic coherence (CACoh) was explored to investigate participants' abilitiy to track music, meanwhile, the phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was utilized to evaluate the cross-modal influences of music. Three months post-intervention, the outcomes of patients with DoC were followed up using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).
RESULTS: HCs and patients with MCS showed higher CACoh compared to VS/UWS patients within musical pulse frequency (p = 0.016, p = 0.045; p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.048, for RM and PM, respectively, following Bonferroni correction). Only theta-gamma PAC demonstrated a significant interaction effect between groups and music conditions (F (2,44) = 2.685, p = 0.036). For HCs, the theta-gamma PAC in the frontal-parietal network was stronger in the PM condition compared to the RM (p = 0.016) and BL condition (p {\textless} 0.001). For patients with MCS, the theta-gamma PAC was stronger in the PM than in the BL (p = 0.040), while no difference was observed among the three music conditions in patients with VS/UWS. Additionally, we found that MCS patients who showed improved outcomes after 3 months exhibited evident neural responses to preferred music (p = 0.019). Furthermore, the ratio of theta-gamma coupling changes in PM relative to BL could predict clinical outcomes in MCS patients (r = 0.992, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Individualized music may serve as a potential therapeutic method for patients with DoC through cross-modal influences, which rely on enhanced theta-gamma PAC within the consciousness-related network.},

	abstract = {Sensory processing is associated with gamma frequency oscillations (30–80 Hz) in sensory cortices. This raises the question whether gamma oscillations can be directly involved in the representation of time-varying stimuli, including stimuli whose time scale is longer than a gamma cycle. We are interested in the ability of the system to reliably distinguish different stimuli while being robust to stimulus variations such as uniform time-warp. We address this issue with a dynamical model of spiking neurons and study the response to an asymmetric sawtooth input current over a range of shape parameters. These parameters describe how fast the input current rises and falls in time. Our network consists of inhibitory and excitatory populations that are sufficient for generating oscillations in the gamma range. The oscillations period is about one-third of the stimulus duration. Embedded in this network is a subpopulation of excitatory cells that respond to the sawtooth stimulus and a subpopulation of cells that respond to an onset cue. The intrinsic gamma oscillations generate a temporally sparse code for the external stimuli. In this code, an excitatory cell may fire a single spike during a gamma cycle, depending on its tuning properties and on the temporal structure of the specific input; the identity of the stimulus is coded by the list of excitatory cells that fire during each cycle. We quantify the properties of this representation in a series of simulations and show that the sparseness of the code makes it robust to uniform warping of the time scale. We find that resetting of the oscillation phase at stimulus onset is important for a reliable representation of the stimulus and that there is a tradeoff between the resolution of the neural representation of the stimulus and robustness to time-warp.},

	abstract = {Depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent among patients with various clinical conditions, resulting in diminished emotional well-being and impaired daily functioning. The neural mechanisms underlying these symptoms, particularly across different disorders, remain unclear, limiting the effectiveness of conventional treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the neural underpinnings of depressive and anxiety symptoms and investigate novel, effective treatments across clinical conditions. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique that can help understand the neural underpinnings of symptoms and facilitate the development of interventions, addressing the two research gaps at both neural and clinical levels. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the existing evidence regarding the therapeutic efficacy of tDCS in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms among individuals with diverse clinical diagnoses. This review evaluated evidence from fifty-six randomized, sham-controlled trials that administered repeated tDCS sessions with a parallel design, applying a three-level meta-analytic model. tDCS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) at 2-mA intensity demonstrates moderate efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms, identifying the left DLPFC as a transdiagnostic neural mechanism of depressive symptoms across clinical conditions. In comparison, the findings on anxiety symptoms demonstrate greater heterogeneity. tDCS over the left DLPFC is effective in reducing depressive symptoms and shows promising effects in alleviating anxiety symptoms among individuals with diverse diagnoses. These findings enhance our understanding of the neuropsychological basis of depressive and anxiety symptoms, laying the groundwork for the development of more effective tDCS interventions applicable across clinical conditions.},

Short-term effects on food consumption, cognition, endocannabinoid (eCB) levels, and electroencephalogram (EEG) markers of future weight loss were explored. Methods Eighteen healthy volunteers with morbid obesity were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Participants received sham or active tDCS plus CT for four consecutive days. Cognitive performance, daily food intake, and eCB blood samples were collected before and after the intervention; EEG data were gathered before and after daily training. Results The active tDCS + CT group reversed left-dominant frontal asymmetry and increased frontal coherence (FC) in the γ-band (30-45 Hz) after the intervention. The strength of the latter predicted BMI reduction. Additionally, a large intervention effect on food intake was shown in the active tDCS + CT group at follow-up (−339.6 ± 639 kcal on average), and there was a decrease of plasma eCB concentrations. Conclusions dlPFC modulation through tDCS + CT is an effective tool to restore right dominance of the dlPFC and enhance FC in patients with morbid obesity. Moreover, the effect of the strength of FC on BMI suggests that the interhemispheric FC at the dlPFC is functionally relevant for the efficient regulation of food choice.},

Hence, the ability to non-invasively modulate the hypothalamus network could open new ways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we tested a novel method for network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in the control of appetite. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity map of the hypothalamus, a 12-channel net-tDCS protocol was generated (Neuroelectrics Starstim system), which included anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation. Ten participants with overweight or obesity were enrolled in a sham-controlled, crossover study. During stimulation or sham control, participants completed a stop-signal task to measure inhibitory control. Overall, stimulation was well tolerated. Anodal net-tDCS resulted in faster stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared to sham (p = 0.039) and cathodal net-tDCS (p = 0.042). Baseline functional connectivity of the target network correlated with SSRT after anodal compared to sham stimulation (p = 0.016). These preliminary data indicate that modulating hypothalamus functional network connectivity via net-tDCS may result in improved inhibitory control. Further studies need to evaluate the effects on eating behavior and metabolism.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In epilepsy, multichannel transcranial direct electrical stimulation (tDCS) is applied to decrease cortical activity through the delivery of weak currents using several scalp electrodes. We investigated the long-term effects of personalized, multisession, stereotactic-EEG (SEEG)-targeted multichannel tDCS on seizure frequency (SF) and functional connectivity (Fc) as measured by EEG in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE).
METHODS: Ten patients suffering from DRE were recruited. Multichannel tDCS (Starstim, Neuroelectrics) was applied during three cycles (one cycle every 2 months) of stimulation. Each cycle consisted of five consecutive days where patients received tDCS daily in two 20 min sessions separated by 20 min. The montages were personalized to target epileptogenic area of each patient as defined by SEEG recordings. SF during and after treatment was compared with baseline. Fc changes were analysed using scalp EEG recordings.
RESULTS: After the last tDCS session, five patients experienced a SF decrease of 50\% or more compared with baseline (R: responders, average SF decrease of 74\%). We estimated Fc changes between cycles and across R and non-responder (NR) patients. R presented a significant decrease in Fc (p {\textless} 0.05) at the third session in alpha and beta frequency bands compared to the first one.
CONCLUSIONS: Multichannel tDCS guided by SEEG is a promising therapeutic approach. Significant response was associated with a decrease of Fc after three stimulation cycles.
SIGNIFICANCE: Such results suggest that tDCS-induced functional plasticity changes that may underlie the clinical response.},

The present study tests the safety, tolerability, and effect size of repeated daily cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in epilepsy have not been established, limiting development of clinically meaningful interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a 2-center, open-label study on 20 participants with medically refractory, focal epilepsy, aged 9 to 56 years (11 women and 9 children younger than18 years). Each participant underwent 10 sessions of 20 minutes of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over 2 weeks. Multielectrode montages were designed using a realistic head model-driven approach to conduct an inhibitory electric field to the target cortical seizure foci and surrounding cortex to suppress excitability and reduce seizure rates. Patients recorded daily seizures using a seizure diary 8 weeks prior, 2 weeks during, and 8 to 12 weeks after the stimulation period.
RESULTS: The median seizure reduction was 44\% relative to baseline and did not differ between adult and pediatric patients. Three patients experienced an increase in seizure frequency of {\textgreater}50\% during the stimulation period; in one, a 36\% increase in seizure frequency persisted through 12 weeks of follow-up. Otherwise, participants experienced only minor adverse events-the most common being scalp discomfort during transcranial direct current stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study supports the safety and efficacy of multifocal, personalized, multichannel, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation for adult and pediatric patients with medication-refractory focal epilepsy, although identifies a possibility of seizure exacerbation in some. The data also provide insight into the effect size to inform the design of a randomized, sham-stimulation controlled trial.},

Despite these efforts, the pathogenesis of ADHD remains elusive. In this Review, we reflect on what has been learned about ADHD while also providing a framework that may serve as a roadmap for future investigations. We emphasize that ADHD is a highly heterogeneous disorder with multiple aetiologies that necessitates a multifactorial dimensional phenotype, rather than a fixed dichotomous conceptualization. We highlight new findings that suggest a more brain-wide, ‘global’ view of the disorder, rather than the traditional localizationist framework, which asserts that a limited set of brain regions or networks underlie ADHD. Last, we underscore how underpowered studies that have aimed to associate neurobiology with ADHD phenotypes have long precluded the field from making progress. However, a new age of ADHD research with refined phenotypes, advanced methods, creative study designs and adequately powered investigations is beginning to put the field on a good footing. Indeed, the field is at a promising juncture to advance the neurobiological understanding of ADHD and fulfil the promise of clinical utility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation has been increasing in popularity in the last few years. Despite vast amounts of articles on the use of tDCS on stroke patients, very little has been done during the acute phase.
OBJECTIVES: Measure the effects of tDCS on functional and sensory outcomes throughout the first year post onset of stroke.
METHODS: 50 acute stroke patients were randomized and placed into either the treatment or sham group. Anodal tDCS was applied (2 mA, 20 min) 5 times a week during the first month post stroke. Patients were evaluated with the Wolf Motor Function Test, the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament Test, the Upper Extremity section (UEFM), the Lower Extremity section (LEFM) and the Somatosensory section of the Fugl Meyer Test, the Tardieu Spasticity Scale, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Barthel Index. Evaluations were held at 48 h post stroke, week 1, 2, 3, 4, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
RESULTS: There were statistically and clinically significant improvements after tDCS in all functional motor outcomes, and somatosensory functions. Differences between both groups for the main outcome (WMFT time) were 51\% (p = 0.04) at one month, and 57\% (p = 0.02) at one year.
CONCLUSION: tDCS seems to be an effective adjuvant to conventional rehabilitation techniques. If applied in the acute stages of stroke, functional recovery is not only accelerated, but improved, and results are maintained up to one-year post stroke.},

We used pictures with different emotional valence (negative, positive, and neutral) as primes and applied electrical painful stimuli as targets to healthy participants.

We found that pain unpleasantness and not pain intensity ratings were modulated by emotion, with increased ratings for negative and decreased ratings for positive pictures. We also found two consecutive gamma band oscillations (GBOs) related to pain processing from time frequency analyses of the EEG signals. The early GBO had a cortical distribution contralateral to the painful stimulus and its amplitude was positively correlated with intensity and unpleasantness ratings, but not with prime valence. The late GBO had a centroparietal distribution and its amplitude was larger for negative compared to neutral and positive pictures. The emotional modulation effect (negative vs. positive) of the late GBO amplitude was positively correlated with pain unpleasantness. The early GBO might reflect the overall pain perception, possibly involving the thalamocortical circuit, while the late GBO might be related to the affective dimension of pain and top-down-related processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The relationship between working memory (WM) and neuronal oscillations can be studied in detail using brain stimulation techniques, which provide a method for modulating these oscillations and thus influencing WM. The endogenous coupling between the amplitude of gamma oscillations and the phase of theta oscillations is crucial for cognitive control. Theta/gamma peak-coupled transcranial alternating current stimulation (TGCp-tACS) can modulate this coupling and thus influence WM performance. This study investigated the effects of TGCp-tACS on WM in older adults and compared their responses with those of younger participants from our previous work who underwent the same experimental design. Twenty-eight older subjects underwent both TGCp-tACS and sham stimulation sessions at least 72 h apart. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and after the interventions, and a WM task battery with five different WM tasks was performed during the interventions to assess various WM components. Outcomes measured included WM task performance (e.g., accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and changes in power spectral density (PSD) in different frequency bands. TGCp-tACS significantly decreased accuracy and RT on the 10- and 14-point Sternberg tasks and increased RT on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in older adults. In contrast, younger participants showed a significant increase in accuracy only on the 14-item Sternberg task. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a decrease in delta and theta PSD and an increase in high gamma PSD in both younger and older participants after verum stimulation. In conclusion, theta-gamma coupling is essential for WM and modulation of this coupling affects WM performance. The effects of TGCp-tACS on WM vary with age due to natural brain changes. To better support older adults, the study suggests several strategies to improve cognitive function, including: Adjusting stimulation parameters, applying stimulation to two sites, conducting multiple sessions, and using brain imaging techniques for precise targeting.},

Synchronization of gamma oscillations is engaged in local computation of feedforward signals and synchronization of alpha-beta oscillations is engaged in feedback processing over long-range areas. These spatially and spectrally segregated bi-directional signals may be integrated by a mechanism of cross-frequency coupling. Synchronization of neural oscillations has also been proposed as a mechanism for information integration across multiple sensory modalities. A transient stimulus or rhythmic stimulus from one modality may lead to phase alignment of ongoing neural oscillations in multiple sensory cortices, through a mechanism of cross-modal phase reset or cross-modal neural entrainment. Synchronized activities in multiple sensory cortices are more likely to boost stronger activities in downstream areas. Compared to synchronized oscillations, asynchronized oscillations may impede signal processing, and may contribute to sensory selection by setting the oscillations in the target-related cortex and the oscillations in the distractor-related cortex to opposite phases.},

	abstract = {Natural speech perception requires processing the ongoing acoustic input while keeping in mind the preceding one and predicting the next. This complex computational problem could be handled by a dynamic multi-timescale hierarchical inferential process that coordinates the information flow up and down the language network hierarchy. Using a predictive coding computational model (Precoss-β) that identifies online individual syllables from continuous speech, we address the advantage of a rhythmic modulation of up and down information flows, and whether beta oscillations could be optimal for this. In the model, and consistent with experimental data, theta and low-gamma neural frequency scales ensure syllable-tracking and phoneme-level speech encoding, respectively, while the beta rhythm is associated with inferential processes. We show that a rhythmic alternation of bottom-up and top-down processing regimes improves syllable recognition, and that optimal efficacy is reached when the alternation of bottom-up and top-down regimes, via oscillating prediction error precisions, is in the beta range (around 20–30 Hz). These results not only demonstrate the advantage of a rhythmic alternation of up- and down-going information, but also that the low-beta range is optimal given sensory analysis at theta and low-gamma scales. While specific to speech processing, the notion of alternating bottom-up and top-down processes with frequency multiplexing might generalize to other cognitive architectures.},

	abstract = {It has previously been shown that generic cortical microcircuit models can perform complex real-time computations on continuous input streams, provided that these computations can be carried out with a rapidly fading memory. We investigate the computational capability of such circuits in the more realistic case where not only readout neurons, but in addition a few neurons within the circuit, have been trained for specific tasks. This is essentially equivalent to the case where the output of trained readout neurons is fed back into the circuit. We show that this new model overcomes the limitation of a rapidly fading memory. In fact, we prove that in the idealized case without noise it can carry out any conceivable digital or analog computation on time-varying inputs. But even with noise, the resulting computational model can perform a large class of biologically relevant real-time computations that require a nonfading memory. We demonstrate these computational implications of feedback both theoretically, and through computer simulations of detailed cortical microcircuit models that are subject to noise and have complex inherent dynamics. We show that the application of simple learning procedures (such as linear regression or perceptron learning) to a few neurons enables such circuits to represent time over behaviorally relevant long time spans, to integrate evidence from incoming spike trains over longer periods of time, and to process new information contained in such spike trains in diverse ways according to the current internal state of the circuit. In particular we show that such generic cortical microcircuits with feedback provide a new model for working memory that is consistent with a large set of biological constraints. Although this article examines primarily the computational role of feedback in circuits of neurons, the mathematical principles on which its analysis is based apply to a variety of dynamical systems. Hence they may also throw new light on the computational role of feedback in other complex biological dynamical systems, such as, for example, genetic regulatory networks.},

Resolving this so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma involves the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Using human intracranial electrophysiological recordings, we discovered that neural activity in the ventral mPFC infers and tracks the reliability of the ongoing plan to proactively encode upcoming action outcomes as either learning signals or potential triggers to explore new plans. By contrast, the dorsal mPFC exhibits neural responses to action outcomes, which results in either improving or abandoning the ongoing plan. Thus, the mPFC resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma through a two-stage, predictive coding process: a proactive ventromedial stage that constructs the functional signification of upcoming action outcomes and a reactive dorsomedial stage that guides behavior in response to action outcomes.},

            We should not be complacent about the risks of developing sentient AI in the near future. Large language models (LLMs) already present some risk. Three other pathways to artificial sentience candidates are also worth taking seriously. The first involves emulating the brains of sentience candidates such as insects, neuron by neuron. The resulting virtual brains are sentience candidates if they display the same pattern of behavioural markers that we take as sufficient for sentience candidature in the biological original. A second path involves evolving artificial agents that converge on similar patterns of behavioural markers to biological sentience candidates. A third involves deliberately implementing a minimal version of a large-scale computational feature credibly linked to sentience in humans. All three pathways present ways in which we might come to recognize a system as an artificial sentience candidate. We must be mindful of the possibility of significant decouplings of sentience from intelligence in this area.},

	abstract = {Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodeling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell type-specific circuits to produce psychedelics' behavioral actions. Here, we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation, and cell type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increased the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviorally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behavior and structural plasticity. Collectively these results identify a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex as playing essential roles for psilocybin's long-term drug action.},

Specifically, we consider deep or hierarchical forms using the renormalisation group. The ensuing renormalising generative models (RGM) can be regarded as discrete homologues of deep convolutional neural networks or continuous state-space models in generalised coordinates of motion. By construction, these scale-invariant models can be used to learn compositionality over space and time, furnishing models of paths or orbits; i.e., events of increasing temporal depth and itinerancy. This technical note illustrates the automatic discovery, learning and deployment of RGMs using a series of applications. We start with image classification and then consider the compression and generation of movies and music. Finally, we apply the same variational principles to the learning of Atari-like games.},

	abstract = {When listening to speech, cortical activity can track mentally constructed linguistic units such as words, phrases, and sentences. Recent studies have also shown that the neural responses to mentally constructed linguistic units can predict the outcome of patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). In healthy individuals, cortical tracking of linguistic units can be driven by both long-term linguistic knowledge and online learning of the transitional probability between syllables. Here, we investigated whether statistical learning could occur in patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS) and patients emerged from the MCS (EMCS) using electroencephalography (EEG). In Experiment 1, we presented to participants an isochronous sequence of syllables, which were composed of either 4 real disyllabic words or 4 reversed disyllabic words. An inter-trial phase coherence analysis revealed that the patient groups showed similar word tracking responses to real and reversed words. In Experiment 2, we presented trisyllabic artificial words that were defined by the transitional probability between words, and a significant word-rate EEG response was observed for MCS patients. These results suggested that statistical learning can occur with a minimal conscious level. The residual statistical learning ability in MCS patients could potentially be harnessed to induce neural plasticity.},

Feedback from higher areas modulates the dynamics of state and action networks in lower areas. I show how the same APC architecture can explain (1) how we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements, (2) why perception seems stable despite eye movements, (3) how we learn compositional representations, for example, part-whole hierarchies, (4) how complex actions can be planned using simpler actions, and (5) how we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences and learn abstract concepts such as a family tree.

Excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. By varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after-effects could be controlled. The effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. Functional alterations related to post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. Transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non-invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way.},

Although understanding empathic impairments in MDD is crucial considering the frequently reported social skill deficits in patients, the current state of research is still inconclusive, pointing to both elevated and impaired levels of empathy. In this review, we extend previous reports of MDD-related aberrations in self-reported and behavioral empathy by shedding light on the neural correlates of empathy in MDD. Study findings indicate a complex and potentially state-dependent association, comprising both elevated and lower neural activity in empathy-related brain regions such as the inferior frontal gyri, bilateral anterior insulae, and cingulate areas. Predominantly, lower activity in these areas seems to be induced by antidepressant treatment or remission, with accompanying behavioral results indicating a reduced negativity-bias in empathic processing compared to acute states of MDD. We propose a preliminary model of empathy development throughout the course of the disorder, comprising initially elevated levels of empathy and a somewhat detached and lower empathic responding during the further progression of the disorder or post-treatment. The seemingly multifaceted nature of the association between empathy and MDD requires further exploration in future multimodal and longitudinal studies. The study of neural correlates of empathy in MDD should prospectively be enlarged by including further socio-affective and -cognitive capacities in MDD and related mental disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations in specific frequency bands coordinates anatomically distributed neuronal processing and communication. Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) or by n:m-cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that interareal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state (RS) brain activity. To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at mesoscale resolution from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and at macroscale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel, to our knowledge, graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from nonsinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine interareal CFC is present in human RS activity in both SEEG and MEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high-frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for interareal CFS and PAC being 2 distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.},

	abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin are serotonergic psychedelic compounds with potential in the treatment of mental health disorders. Past neuroimaging investigations have revealed that both compounds can elicit significant changes to whole-brain functional organization and dynamics. A recent proposal linked past findings into a unified model and hypothesized reduced whole-brain hierarchical organization as a key mechanism underlying the psychedelic state, but this has yet to be directly tested. We applied a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique previously used to map hierarchical connectivity gradients to assess cortical organization in the LSD and psilocybin state from two previously published pharmacological resting-state fMRI datasets (N = 15 and 9, respectively). Results supported our primary hypothesis: The principal gradient of cortical connectivity, describing a hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal cortex, was significantly flattened under both drugs relative to their respective placebo conditions. Between-condition contrasts revealed that this was driven by a reduction of functional differentiation at both hierarchical extremes – default and frontoparietal networks at the upper end, and somatomotor at the lower. Gradient-based connectivity mapping indicated that this was underpinned by a disruption of modular unimodal connectivity and increased unimodal-transmodal crosstalk. Results involving the second and third gradient, which, respectively represent axes of sensory and executive differentiation, also showed significant alterations across both drugs. These findings provide support for a recent mechanistic model of the psychedelic state relevant to therapeutic applications of psychedelics. More fundamentally, we provide the first evidence that macroscale connectivity gradients are sensitive to an acute pharmacological manipulation, supporting a role for psychedelics as scientific tools to perturb cortical functional organization.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique involving administration of well-tolerated electrical current to the brain through scalp electrodes. TDCS may improve symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders, but mixed results from recent clinical trials underscore the need to demonstrate that tDCS can modulate clinically relevant brain systems over time in patients. Here, we analyzed longitudinal structural MRI data from a randomized, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial in depression (NCT03556124, N = 59) to investigate whether serial tDCS individually targeted to the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can induce neurostructural changes. Significant (FWEc p {\textless} 0.05) treatment-related gray matter changes were observed with active high-definition (HD) tDCS relative to sham tDCS within the left DLPFC stimulation target. No changes were observed with active conventional tDCS. A follow-up analysis within individual treatment groups revealed significant gray matter increases with active HD-tDCS in brain regions functionally connected with the stimulation target, including the bilateral DLPFC, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and the right hippocampus, thalamus and left caudate brain regions. Integrity of blinding was verified, no significant differences in stimulation-related discomfort were observed between treatment groups, and tDCS treatments were not augmented by any other adjunct treatments. Overall, these results demonstrate that serial HD-tDCS leads to neurostructural changes at a predetermined brain target in depression and suggest that such plasticity effects may propagate over brain networks.},

Seven days of auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice.

Furthermore, combined auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in medial prefrontal cortex.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with alterations in cortical perfusion that correlate with cognitive impairment. Recently, neural activity in the gamma band has been identified as a driver of arteriolar vasomotion while, on the other hand, gamma activity induction on preclinical models of AD has been shown to promote protein clearance and cognitive protection.
METHODS: In two open-label studies, we assessed the possibility to modulate cerebral perfusion in 15 mild to moderate AD participants via 40Hz (gamma) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) administered 1 h daily for 2 or 4 weeks, primarily targeting the temporal lobe. Perfusion-sensitive MRI scans were acquired at baseline and right after the intervention, along with electrophysiological recording and cognitive assessments.
RESULTS: No serious adverse effects were reported by any of the participants. Arterial spin labeling MRI revealed a significant increase in blood perfusion in the bilateral temporal lobes after the tACS treatment. Moreover, perfusion changes displayed a positive correlation with changes in episodic memory and spectral power changes in the gamma band.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest 40Hz tACS should be further investigated in larger placebo-controlled trials as a safe, non-invasive countermeasure to increase fast brain oscillatory activity and increase perfusion in critical brain areas in AD patients.

Building on these ideas, we introduce Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) as a dynamical alternative to threshold units, which can be combined with arbitrary connectivity designs such as fully connected, convolutional, or attentive mechanisms. Our generalized Kuramoto updates bind neurons together through their synchronization dynamics. We show that this idea provides performance improvements across a wide spectrum of tasks such as unsupervised object discovery, adversarial robustness, calibrated uncertainty quantification, and reasoning. We believe that these empirical results show the importance of rethinking our assumptions at the most basic neuronal level of neural representation, and in particular show the importance of dynamical representations.},

	abstract = {Parkinsonism is associated with changes in oscillatory activity patterns and increased synchronization of neurons in the basal ganglia and cortex in patients and animal models of Parkinson's disease, but the relationship between these changes and the severity of parkinsonian signs remains unclear. We examined this relationship by studying changes in local field potentials (LFPs) in the internal pallidal segment (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and in encephalographic signals (EEG) from the primary motor cortex (M1) in Rhesus monkeys which were rendered progressively parkinsonian by repeated systemic injections of small doses of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Observations during wakefulness and sleep (defined by EEG and video records) were analyzed separately. The severity of parkinsonism correlated with increases in spectral power at frequencies below 15.5Hz in M1 and GPi and reductions in spectral power at frequencies above 15.6Hz with little change in STN. The severity of parkinsonism also correlated with increases in the coherence between M1 EEG and basal ganglia LFPs in the low frequency band. Levodopa treatment reduced low-frequency activity and increased high-frequency activity in all three areas, but did not affect coherence. The state of arousal also affected LFP and EEG signals in all three structures, particularly in the STN. These results suggest that parkinsonism-associated changes in alpha and low-beta band oscillatory activity can be detected early in the parkinsonian state in M1 and GPi. Interestingly, oscillations detectable in STN LFP signals (including oscillations in the beta-band) do not appear to correlate strongly with the severity of mild-to-moderate parkinsonism in these animals. Levodopa-induced changes in oscillatory M1 EEG and basal ganglia LFP patterns do not necessarily represent a normalization of abnormalities caused by dopamine depletion.},

	abstract = {Several lines of inquiry have separately identified beta oscillations, synchrony, waveform shape, and phase-amplitude coupling as important but sometimes inconsistent factors in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. What has so far been lacking is a means by which these neurophysiological parameters are interrelated and how they relate to clinical symptomatology. To clarify the relationship among oscillatory power, bursting, synchrony, and phase-amplitude coupling, we recorded local field potentials/electrocorticography from hand motor and premotor cortical area in human subjects with c (N = 10) and Parkinson's disease (N = 22) during deep brain stimulator implantation surgery (14 females, 18 males). We show that motor cortical high beta oscillations in Parkinson's disease demonstrate increased burst durations relative to essential tremor patients. Notably, increased corticocortical synchrony between primary motor and premotor cortices precedes motor high beta bursts, suggesting a possible causal relationship between corticocortical synchrony and localized increases in beta power. We further show that high beta bursts are associated with significant changes in waveform shape and that beta-encoded phase-amplitude coupling is more evident during periods of high beta bursting. These findings reveal a deeper structure to the pathologic changes identified in the neurophysiology of Parkinson's disease, suggesting mechanisms by which the treatment may be enhanced using targeted network synchrony disruption approaches.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Understanding Parkinson's disease pathophysiology is crucial for optimizing symptom management. Present inconsistencies in the literature may be explained by temporal transients in neural signals driven by transient fluctuations in network synchrony. Synchrony may also act as a unifying phenomenon for the pathophysiological observations reported in Parkinson's disease. Here, simultaneous recordings from motor cortices show that increases in network beta synchrony anticipate episodes of beta bursting. We furthermore identify beta bursting as being associated with changes in waveform shape and increases in phase-amplitude coupling. Our results identify network synchrony as a driver of various pathophysiological observations reported in the literature and account for inconsistencies in the literature by virtue of the temporally variable nature of the phenomenon.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Identifying biomarkers of developing mental disorder is crucial to improving early identification and treatment—a key strategy for reducing the burden of mental disorders. Cross-frequency coupling between two different frequencies of neural oscillations is one such promising measure, believed to reflect synchronization between local and global networks in the brain. Specifically, in adults phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) has been shown to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, including working and long-term memory, attention, language, and fluid intelligence. Evidence suggests that increased PAC mediates both temporary and lasting improvements in working memory elicited by transcranial direct-current stimulation and reductions in depressive symptoms after transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, research has shown that abnormal patterns of PAC are associated with depression and schizophrenia in adults. PAC is believed to be closely related to cortico-cortico white matter (WM) microstructure, which is well established in the literature as a structural mechanism underlying mental health. Some cognitive findings have been replicated in adolescents and abnormal patterns of PAC have also been linked to ADHD in young people. However, currently most research has focused on cross-sectional adult samples. Whereas initial hypotheses suggested that PAC was a state-based measure due to an early focus on cognitive, task-based research, current evidence suggests that PAC has both state-based and stable components. Future longitudinal research focusing on PAC throughout adolescent development could further our understanding of the relationship between mental health and cognition and facilitate the development of new methods for the identification and treatment of youth mental health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cross-frequency interactions may coordinate neural circuits operating at different frequencies. While neural oscillations associated with particular circuits in schizophrenia (SZ) are impaired, few studies have examined cross-frequency interactions. Here we examined phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the electroencephalograms of individuals with SZ and healthy control subjects (HCs). We computed PAC during the baseline period of 40-Hz auditory steady-state stimulation and rest. We hypothesized that subjects with SZ would show abnormal theta/gamma coupling during stimulation, especially in the left auditory cortex, and coupling with high frequencies would be higher during stimulation than during rest.
METHODS: We reanalyzed data from 18 subjects with SZ and 18 HCs. Auditory cortex electroencephalogram activity was estimated using dipole source localization. PAC was computed using the debiased PAC measure, calculated with the generalized Morse wavelet transform. PAC clusters were identified using cluster-corrected permutation testing and interrogated in analyses of variance with correction for multiple tests.
RESULTS: Overall, coupling of high beta and gamma amplitude was higher during the auditory steady-state response, while alpha/beta PAC was higher during rest. Theta/alpha PAC was higher in subjects with SZ than in HCs. Theta/gamma PAC was lateralized to the left hemisphere in HCs but was not lateralized in subjects with SZ.
CONCLUSIONS: PAC involving high frequencies was state dependent and not abnormal in SZ. Increased theta/alpha PAC in subjects with SZ was consistent with other evidence of increased low-frequency activity. Hemispheric lateralization of theta/gamma PAC was reduced in subjects with SZ, consistent with evidence for left hemisphere auditory cortex abnormalities in subjects with SZ. PAC may reveal new insights into neural circuitry abnormalities in SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Background Impairment of gamma oscillations has been observed in cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Gamma entrainment using 40Hz auditory or visual stimulation has been proposed as a potential treatment for AD (Adaikkan et al., Trends in Neuroscience 2020; Sedghizadeh et al. Alzheimer’s and Dementia 2020), while simultaneous use of both modalities has been reported to show superior therapeutic results (Martorell et al., Cell 2019; Suk et al. Alzheimer’s and Dementia 2020). Gamma and theta oscillations are both produced in the hippocampal area and interact with each other. Evidence shows that the interaction between these bands leads to their phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) in the frontal cortex (Amemiya et al., Cell Reports 2018). The current study assesses the effects of 40Hz auditory and visual stimulation on the theta-gamma PAC, and suggests that the superior performance of multimodal entrainment can be explained by this marker. Method 10 cognitively healthy participants were included in this study. Each participant was seated in a dark and quiet room and underwent three sessions of sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, and simultaneous (multimodal) visual and auditory) in a randomized order. Each session consisted of 60 trials of 5s stimulation and 5s rest. The auditory stimulation consisted of a 40Hz clicking sound modulated with a career frequency of 5kHz. The visual stimulation was generated using white LEDs flickering at 40Hz. EEG data were acquired and the theta-gamma PAC was calculated using the time-frequency mean vector length (tf-MVL) method (Munia et al., Scientific Reports 2019). Result The PAC value for theta (4-8Hz) and gamma oscillations near the stimulation frequency (39-41Hz) on the Fz channel showed a significant increase during the multimodal stimulation intervals compared to the resting state, whereas the increase was not significant during the single-modal stimulations compared to rest. The multimodal stimulation also involved more brain areas and resulted in a higher PAC compared to single-modal stimulation. Conclusion Entraining gamma oscillations using simultaneous auditory and visual stimulation results in markedly superior theta-gamma PAC compared to entrainment with single modalities. This superiority can explain the advantages reported for multimodal entrainment in AD therapy experiments.},

Preclinical studies on neuronal impairments associated with progressive amyloidosis have demonstrated some Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction including modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic signaling. The present work focuses on the early stage of disease progression and uses TgF344-AD rats that recapitulate a broad repertoire of AD-like pathologies to investigate the neuronal network functioning using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the hippocampus (HPC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), followed by pathological analyses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA ) receptor subunits α1, α5, and δ, and glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67). Concomitant to amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, low-gamma band power was strongly attenuated in the HPC and mPFC of TgF344-AD rats in comparison to those in non-transgenic littermates. In addition, the phase-amplitude coupling of the neuronal networks in both areas was impaired, evidenced by decreased modulation of theta band phase on gamma band amplitude in TgF344-AD animals. Finally, the gamma coherence between HPC and mPFC was attenuated as well. These results demonstrate significant neuronal network dysfunction at an early stage of AD-like pathology. This network dysfunction precedes the onset of cognitive deficits and is likely driven by Aβ and tau pathologies. This article is part of the Special Issue "Vascular Dementia".},

We found that SF networks facilitate PAC between slow and fast frequency components of the information flow, whereas ER networks enable PAC between slow-frequency components. Nodes contributing the most to the generation of PAC in SF networks were non-hubs that connected with high probability to hubs. Additionally, brain networks from healthy controls (HC) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients presented a weaker PAC between slow and fast frequencies than SF, but higher than ER. We found that PAC decreased in AD compared to HC and was more strongly correlated to the scores of two different cognitive tests than what the strength of functional connectivity was, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment and multi-scale information flow in the brain.},

	abstract = {While animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have shown altered gamma oscillations (∼40 Hz) in local neural circuits, the low signal-to-noise ratio of gamma in the resting human brain precludes its quantification via conventional spectral estimates. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) indicating the dynamic integration between the gamma amplitude and the phase of low-frequency (4–12 Hz) oscillations is a useful alternative to capture local gamma activity. In addition, PAC is also an index of neuronal excitability as the phase of low-frequency oscillations that modulate gamma amplitude, effectively regulates the excitability of local neuronal firing. In this study, we sought to examine the local neuronal activity and excitability using gamma PAC, within brain regions vulnerable to early AD pathophysiology—entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus, in a clinical population of patients with AD and age-matched controls. Our clinical cohorts consisted of a well-characterized cohort of AD patients (n = 50; age, 60 ± 8 years) with positive AD biomarkers, and age-matched, cognitively unimpaired controls (n = 35; age, 63 ± 5.8 years). We identified the presence or the absence of epileptiform activity in AD patients (AD patients with epileptiform activity, AD-EPI+, n = 20; AD patients without epileptiform activity, AD-EPI−, n = 30) using long-term electroencephalography (LTM-EEG) and 1-hour long magnetoencephalography (MEG) with simultaneous EEG. Using the source reconstructed MEG data, we computed gamma PAC as the coupling between amplitude of the gamma frequency (30–40 Hz) with phase of the theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz) frequency oscillations, within entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. We found that patients with AD have reduced gamma PAC in the left parahippocampal cortex, compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, AD-EPI+ patients showed greater reductions in gamma PAC than AD-EPI− in bilateral parahippocampal cortices. In contrast, entorhinal cortices did not show gamma PAC abnormalities in patients with AD. Our findings demonstrate the spatial patterns of altered gamma oscillations indicating possible region-specific manifestations of network hyperexcitability within medial temporal lobe regions vulnerable to AD pathophysiology. Greater deficits in AD-EPI+ suggests that reduced gamma PAC is a sensitive index of network hyperexcitability in AD patients. Collectively, the current results emphasize the importance of investigating the role of neural circuit hyperexcitability in early AD pathophysiology and explore its potential as a modifiable contributor to AD pathobiology.},

	abstract = {Psilocybin produces an altered state of consciousness in humans and is associated with complex spatiotemporal changes in brain networks. Given the emphasis on rodent models for mechanistic studies, there is a need for characterization of the effect of psilocybin on brain-wide network dynamics. Previous rodent studies of psychedelics, using electroencephalogram, have primarily been done with sparse electrode arrays that offered limited spatial resolution precluding network level analysis, and have been restricted to lower gamma frequencies. Therefore, in the study, we used electroencephalographic recordings from 27 sites (electrodes) across rat cortex (n=6 male, 6 female) to characterize the effect of psilocybin (0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg delivered over an hour) on network organization as inferred through changes in node degree (index of network density) and connection strength (weighted phase-lag index). The removal of aperiodic component from the electroencephalogram localized the primary oscillatory changes to theta (4-10 Hz), medium gamma (70-110 Hz), and high gamma (110-150 Hz) bands, which were used for the network analysis. Additionally, we determined the concurrent changes in theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. We report that psilocybin, in a dose-dependent manner, 1) disrupted theta-gamma coupling [p{\textless}0.05], 2) increased frontal high gamma connectivity [p{\textless}0.05] and posterior theta connectivity [p≤0.049], and 3) increased frontal high gamma [p{\textless}0.05] and posterior theta [p≤0.046] network density. The medium gamma frontoparietal connectivity showed a nonlinear relationship with psilocybin dose. Our results suggest that high-frequency network organization, decoupled from local theta-phase, may be an important signature of psilocybin-induced non-ordinary state of consciousness.},

Gamma-band (30-90 Hz) synchronization modulates excitation rapidly enough that it escapes the following inhibition and activates postsynaptic neurons effectively. Synchronization also ensures that a presynaptic activation pattern arrives at postsynaptic neurons in a temporally coordinated manner. At a postsynaptic neuron, multiple presynaptic groups converge, e.g., representing different stimuli. If a stimulus is selected by attention, its neuronal representation shows stronger and higher-frequency gamma-band synchronization. Thereby, the attended stimulus representation selectively entrains postsynaptic neurons. The entrainment creates sequences of short excitation and longer inhibition that are coordinated between pre- and postsynaptic groups to transmit the attended representation and shut out competing inputs. The predominantly bottom-up-directed gamma-band influences are controlled by predominantly top-down-directed alpha-beta-band (8-20 Hz) influences. Attention itself samples stimuli at a 7-8 Hz theta rhythm. Thus, several rhythms and their interplay render neuronal communication effective, precise, and selective.},

We demonstrate that, when participants are cued with the image of an object whose location they must subsequently navigate to, there is a significant increase in 4-8 Hz theta power in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the phase of this oscillation is coupled both with ongoing theta phase in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and perceptually induced 65-85 Hz gamma amplitude in medial parietal cortex.

Here, we address this question reviewing the mechanisms of gamma-band oscillation generation and the functions associated with gamma-band activity across several cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, we raise a plausible explanation of why gamma rhythms are found so ubiquitously across brain structures. Gamma band activity originates from the interplay between inhibition and excitation. We stress that gamma oscillations, associated with this interplay, originate from basic functional motifs that conferred advantages for low-level system processing and multiple cognitive functions throughout evolution. We illustrate the multifunctionality of gamma-band activity by considering its role in neural systems for perception, selective attention, memory, motivation and behavioral control. We conclude that gamma-band oscillations support multiple cognitive processes, rather than a single one, which, however, can be traced back to a limited set of circuit motifs which are found universally across species and brain structures.},

Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation (GENUS) is an emerging treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders that uses sensory stimulation to entrain impaired oscillatory network activity and restore brain function. Aberrant oscillatory activity often underlies the symptoms experienced by patients with schizophrenia. We propose that GENUS has therapeutic potential for schizophrenia. This paper reviews the current status of schizophrenia treatment and explores the use of sensory stimulation as an adjunctive treatment, specifically through gamma entrainment. Impaired gamma frequency entrainment is observed in patients, particularly in response to auditory and visual stimuli. Thus, sensory stimulation, such as music listening, may have therapeutic potential for individuals with schizophrenia. GENUS holds novel therapeutic potential to improve the lives of individuals with schizophrenia, but further research is required to determine the efficacy of GENUS, optimize its delivery and therapeutic window, and develop strategies for its implementation in specific patient populations.},

	abstract = {Gamma oscillation is the synchronization with a frequency of 30-90 Hz of neural oscillations, which are rhythmic electric processes of neuron groups in the brain. The inhibitory interneuron network is necessary for the production of gamma oscillations, but certain disruptions such as brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic imbalances can cause this network to malfunction. Gamma oscillations specifically control the connectivity between different brain regions, which is crucial for perception, movement, memory, and emotion. Studies have linked abnormal gamma oscillations to conditions of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli (GENUS) provides significant neuroprotection. This review discusses the function of gamma oscillations in advanced brain activities from both a physiological and pathological standpoint, and it emphasizes gamma entrainment as a potential therapeutic approach for a range of neuropsychiatric diseases.},

It is proposed here that gamma and theta oscillations allow for the transient interaction between cortical structures and the hippocampus for the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories as described by the hippocampal memory indexing theory (Teyler and DiScenna, 1986). Gamma rhythms can act in the cortex to bind perceptual features and in the hippocampus to bind the rich perceptual and contextual information from diverse brain regions into episodic representations. Theta oscillations act to temporally order these individual episodic memory representations. Through feedback projections from the hippocampus to the cortex these gamma and theta patterns could cause the reinstatement of the entire episodic memory representation in the cortex. In addition, theta oscillations could allow for top-down control from the frontal cortex to the hippocampus modulating the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories.},

However, its functional role has been difficult to elucidate. The advent of novel techniques, particularly transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has dramatically increased our ability to study γ oscillations. Here, we review our current understanding of the role of γ oscillations in the human motor cortex, with reference to γ activity outside the motor system, and evidence from animal models.
RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence for the neurophysiological basis of human γ oscillations is beginning to emerge. Multimodal studies, essential given the necessarily indirect measurements acquired in humans, are beginning to provide convergent evidence for the role of γ oscillations in movement, and their relationship to plasticity.
SUMMARY: Human motor cortical γ oscillations appear to play a key role in movement, and relate to learning. However, there are still major questions to be answered about their physiological basis and precise role in human plasticity. It is to be hoped that future research will take advantage of recent technical advances and the physiological basis and functional significance of this intriguing and important brain rhythm will be fully elucidated.},

Thus, it appears as if many different gamma-band synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence, which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses. However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which then subserves numerous higher cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Gamma rhythms are commonly observed in many brain regions during both waking and sleep states, yet their functions and mechanisms remain a matter of debate. Here we review the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations and outline empirical questions and controversial conceptual issues. Our main points are as follows: First, gamma-band rhythmogenesis is inextricably tied to perisomatic inhibition. Second, gamma oscillations are short-lived and typically emerge from the coordinated interaction of excitation and inhibition, which can be detected as local field potentials. Third, gamma rhythm typically concurs with irregular firing of single neurons, and the network frequency of gamma oscillations varies extensively depending on the underlying mechanism. To document gamma oscillations, efforts should be made to distinguish them from mere increases of gamma-band power and/or increased spiking activity. Fourth, the magnitude of gamma oscillation is modulated by slower rhythms. Such cross-frequency coupling may serve to couple active patches of cortical circuits. Because of their ubiquitous nature and strong correlation with the "operational modes" of local circuits, gamma oscillations continue to provide important clues about neuronal population dynamics in health and disease.},

It has been proposed that high- and low-frequency neuronal oscillations act as carriers of sensory evidence and top-down predictions, respectively (von Stein and Sarnthein 2000; Bastos et al. 2012). However, evidence for the latter hypothesis remains scarce. In particular, it remains to be shown whether slow prestimulus alpha oscillations in task-relevant brain regions are stronger in the presence of predictions, whether they influence early categorization processes, and whether this interplay indeed boosts perception. Here, we directly address these questions by manipulating subjects' prior expectations about the identity of visually presented letters while collecting magnetoencephalographic recordings. We find that predictions lead to increased prestimulus alpha oscillations in a multisensory network representing grapheme/phoneme associations. Furthermore, alpha power interacts with stimulus degradation and top-down expectations to predict visibility ratings, and correlates with the amplitude of early sensory components (P1/N1m complex), suggesting a role in the selective amplification of predicted information. Our results thus indicate that low-frequency alpha oscillations can serve as a mechanism to carry and test sensory predictions about letters.},

	abstract = {The auditory cortex (AC) encompasses distinct fields subserving partly different aspects of sound processing. One essential function of the AC is the detection of unpredicted sounds, as revealed by differential neural activity to predictable and unpredictable sounds. According to the predictive coding framework, this effect can be explained by repetition suppression and/or prediction error signaling. The present study investigates functional specialization of the rat AC fields in repetition suppression and prediction error by combining a tone frequency oddball paradigm (involving high-probable standard and low-probable deviant tones) with two different control sequences (many-standards and cascade). Tones in the control sequences were comparable to deviant events with respect to neural adaptation but were not violating a regularity. Therefore, a difference in the neural activity between deviant and control tones indicates a prediction error effect, whereas a difference between control and standard tones indicates a repetition suppression effect. Single-unit recordings revealed by far the largest prediction error effects for the posterior auditory field, while the primary auditory cortex, the anterior auditory field, the ventral auditory field, and the suprarhinal auditory field were dominated by repetition suppression effects. Statistically significant repetition suppression effects occurred in all AC fields, whereas prediction error effects were less robust in the primary auditory cortex and the anterior auditory field. Results indicate that the non-lemniscal, posterior auditory field is more engaged in context-dependent processing underlying deviance-detection than the other AC fields, which are more sensitive to stimulus-dependent effects underlying differential degrees of neural adaptation.},

	abstract = {The traditional belief is that the event-related alpha response can solely be described in terms of suppression or event-related desynchronization (ERD). Recent research, however, has shown that under certain conditions alpha responds reliably with an increase in amplitudes (event-related synchronization or ERS). ERS is elicited in situations, where subjects withhold or control the execution of a response and is obtained over sites that probably are under, or exert top-down control. Thus, we assume that alpha ERS reflects top-down, inhibitory control processes. This assumption leads over to the timing aspect of our hypothesis. By the very nature of an oscillation, rhythmic amplitude changes reflect rhythmic changes in excitation of a population of neurons. Thus, the time and direction of a change - described by phase - is functionally related to the timing of neuronal activation processes. A variety of findings supports this view and shows, e.g., that alpha phase coherence increases between task-relevant sites and that phase lag lies within a time range that is consistent with neuronal transmission speed. Another implication is that phase reset will be a powerful mechanism for the event-related timing of cortical processes. Empirical evidence suggests that the extent of phase locking is a functionally sensitive measure that is related to cognitive performance. Our general conclusion is that alpha ERS plays an active role for the inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing whereas ERD reflects the gradual release of inhibition associated with the emergence of complex spreading activation processes.},

	doi = {10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00056-3},
	abstract = {Evidence is presented that EEG oscillations in the alpha and theta band reflect cognitive and memory performance in particular. Good performance is related to two types of EEG phenomena (i) a tonic increase in alpha but a decrease in theta power, and (ii) a large phasic (event-related) decrease in alpha but increase in theta, depending on the type of memory demands. Because alpha frequency shows large interindividual differences which are related to age and memory performance, this double dissociation between alpha vs. theta and tonic vs. phasic changes can be observed only if fixed frequency bands are abandoned. It is suggested to adjust the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each subject by using individual alpha frequency as an anchor point. Based on this procedure, a consistent interpretation of a variety of findings is made possible. As an example, in a similar way as brain volume does, upper alpha power increases (but theta power decreases) from early childhood to adulthood, whereas the opposite holds true for the late part of the lifespan. Alpha power is lowered and theta power enhanced in subjects with a variety of different neurological disorders. Furthermore, after sustained wakefulness and during the transition from waking to sleeping when the ability to respond to external stimuli ceases, upper alpha power decreases, whereas theta increases. Event-related changes indicate that the extent of upper alpha desynchronization is positively correlated with (semantic) long-term memory performance, whereas theta synchronization is positively correlated with the ability to encode new information. The reviewed findings are interpreted on the basis of brain oscillations. It is suggested that the encoding of new information is reflected by theta oscillations in hippocampo-cortical feedback loops, whereas search and retrieval processes in (semantic) long-term memory are reflected by upper alpha oscillations in thalamo-cortical feedback loops.},

Although this phenomenon suggests that these oscillations may phasically route information through functional networks, many accounts treat these periodic effects as a consequence of ongoing activity that is independent of behavioral strategy. Here, we investigated whether alpha-band phase can be guided by top-down control in a temporal cueing task. When participants were provided with cues predictive of the moment of visual target onset, discrimination accuracy improved and targets were more frequently reported as consciously seen, relative to unpredictive cues. This effect was accompanied by a significant shift in the phase of alpha-band oscillations, before target onset, toward each participant’s optimal phase for stimulus discrimination. These findings provide direct evidence that forming predictions about when a stimulus will appear can bias the phase of ongoing alpha-band oscillations toward an optimal phase for visual processing, and may thus serve as a mechanism for the top-down control of visual processing guided by temporal predictions.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical predictive coding networks are a general model of sensory processing in the brain. Under neural delays, these networks have been suggested to naturally generate oscillatory activity in approximately the α frequency range (∼8-12 Hz). This suggests that α oscillations, a prominent feature of EEG recordings, may be a spectral “fingerprint” of predictive sensory processing. Here, we probed this possibility by investigating whether oscillations over the visual cortex predictively encode visual information. Specifically, we examined whether their power carries information about the position of a moving stimulus, in a temporally predictive fashion. In two experiments (
              N
              = 32, 18 female;
              N
              = 34, 17 female), participants viewed an apparent-motion stimulus moving along a circular path while EEG was recorded. To investigate the encoding of stimulus-position information, we developed a method of deriving probabilistic spatial maps from oscillatory power estimates. With this method, we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct the trajectory of a moving stimulus from α/low-β oscillations, tracking its position even across unexpected motion reversals. We also show that future position representations are activated in the absence of direct visual input, demonstrating that temporally predictive mechanisms manifest in α/β band oscillations. In a second experiment, we replicate these findings and show that the encoding of information in this range is not driven by visual entrainment. By demonstrating that occipital α/β oscillations carry stimulus-related information, in a temporally predictive fashion, we provide empirical evidence of these rhythms as a spectral “fingerprint” of hierarchical predictive processing in the human visual system.
            
            
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              “Hierarchical predictive coding” is a general model of sensory information processing in the brain. When
              in silico
              predictive coding models are constrained by neural transmission delays, their activity naturally oscillates in roughly the α range (∼8-12 Hz). Using time-resolved EEG decoding, we show that neural rhythms in this approximate range (α/low-β) over the human visual cortex predictively encode the position of a moving stimulus. From the amplitude of these oscillations, we are able to reconstruct the stimulus' trajectory, revealing signatures of temporally predictive processing. This provides direct neural evidence linking occipital α/β rhythms to predictive visual processing, supporting the emerging view of such oscillations as a potential spectral “fingerprint” of hierarchical predictive processing in the human visual system.},

Comparable to theta, a load dependent increase in power can be observed during retention and increased evoked activity during retrieval. During retrieval attempts theta behaves like a traveling wave spreading from anterior to posterior sites. During actual retrieval, however, evoked upper alpha becomes transiently nested in theta. We suggest that theta reflects working memory functions whereas upper alpha may be important for the reactivation of long-term memory codes in short-term memory.},

The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain.},

We here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization in the gamma band (30–100 Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas. In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework. Given that alpha activity is by far the strongest signal recorded by EEG and MEG, we propose that a major part of the electrophysiological activity detected from the working brain reflects gating by inhibition.},

Using laminar probes, we recorded LFPs from 14 cortical areas across the cortical hierarchy in five macaque monkeys. The laminar locations of recordings were histologically identified by electrolytic lesions. Across all areas, we found a ubiquitous spectrolaminar pattern characterized by an increasing deep-to-superficial layer gradient of high-frequency power peaking in layers 2/3 and an increasing superficial-to-deep gradient of alpha-beta power peaking in layers 5/6. Laminar recordings from additional species showed that the spectrolaminar pattern is highly preserved among primates—macaque, marmoset and human—but more dissimilar in mouse.

We addressed this question by modeling empirical cross spectra using a neural mass model equipped with superficial and deep pyramidal cell populations—that model the source of forward and backward connections, respectively. This enabled us to reconstruct the transfer functions and associated spectra of specific subpopulations within cortical sources. We first established that Bayesian model comparison was able to discriminate between forward and backward connections, defined in terms of their cells of origin. We then confirmed that model selection was able to identify extrastriate (V4) sources as being hierarchically higher than early visual (V1) sources. Finally, an examination of the auto spectra and transfer functions associated with superficial and deep pyramidal cells confirmed that forward connections employed predominantly higher (gamma) frequencies, while backward connections were mediated by lower (alpha/beta) frequencies.

	abstract = {Negative bias is an essential characteristic of depressive episodes leading patients to attribute more negative valence to environmental cues. This negative bias affects all levels of information processing including emotional response, attention and memory, leading to the development and maintenance of depressive symptoms. In this context, pleasant stimuli become less attractive and unpleasant ones more aversive, yet the related neural circuits underlying this bias remain largely unknown. By studying a mice model for depression chronically receiving corticosterone (CORT), we showed a negative bias in valence attribution to olfactory stimuli that responds to antidepressant drug. This result paralleled the alterations in odor value assignment we observed in bipolar depressed patients. Given the crucial role of amygdala in valence coding and its strong link with depression, we hypothesized that basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuits alterations might support negative shift associated with depressive states. Contrary to humans, where limits in spatial resolution of imaging tools impair easy amygdala segmentation, recently unravelled specific BLA circuits implicated in negative and positive valence attribution could be studied in mice. Combining CTB and rabies-based tracing with ex vivo measurements of neuronal activity, we demonstrated that negative valence bias is supported by disrupted activity of specific BLA circuits during depressive states. Chronic CORT administration induced decreased recruitment of BLA-to-NAc neurons preferentially involved in positive valence encoding, while increasing recruitment of BLA-to-CeA neurons preferentially involved in negative valence encoding. Importantly, this dysfunction was dampened by chemogenetic hyperactivation of BLA-to-NAc neurons. Moreover, altered BLA activity correlated with durable presynaptic connectivity changes coming from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, recently demonstrated as orchestrating valence assignment in the amygdala. Together, our findings suggest that specific BLA circuits alterations might support negative bias in depressive states and provide new avenues for translational research to understand the mechanisms underlying depression and treatment efficacy.},

A number of frontal and posterior parietal cortical areas, referred to collectively as the fronto-parietal attentional control network, are engaged during attentional allocation in both humans and non-human primates. Numerous studies have examined this network in the human brain using various neuroimaging and scalp electrophysiological techniques. However, little is known about how these frontal and parietal areas interact dynamically to produce behavior on a fine temporal (sub-second) and spatial (sub-centimeter) scale. We addressed how human fronto-parietal regions control visuospatial attention on a fine spatiotemporal scale by recording electrocorticography (ECoG) signals measured directly from subdural electrode arrays that were implanted in patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic foci. Subjects (n = 8) performed a spatial-cuing task, in which they allocated visuospatial attention to either the right or left visual field and detected the appearance of a target. We found increases in high gamma (HG) power (70-250 Hz) time-locked to trial onset that remained elevated throughout the attentional allocation period over frontal, parietal, and visual areas. These HG power increases were modulated by the phase of the ongoing delta/theta (2-5 Hz) oscillation during attentional allocation. Critically, we found that the strength of this delta/theta phase-HG amplitude coupling predicted reaction times to detected targets on a trial-by-trial basis. These results highlight the role of delta/theta phase-HG amplitude coupling as a mechanism for sub-second facilitation and coordination within human fronto-parietal cortex that is guided by momentary attentional demands.},

Here, we validated PLE and LZC (calculated in a dynamic way) as benchmarks of a wide range of arousal states across different reference states of consciousness (e.g., awake, sleep stages, ketamine, sevoflurane). We show a tendency toward high PLE and low LZC, with high intra-subject fluctuations and inter-subject variability in a cohort of CLIS patients with values graded along different arousal states as in our reference data sets.

The first is `being there', often called `presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this Place Illusion (PI). Second, Plausibility Illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that that they are not `there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, and the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.},

	abstract = {Spatial attention is the cognitive function that coordinates the selection of visual stimuli with appropriate behavioral responses. Recent studies have reported that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of low and high frequencies covaries with spatial attention, but differ on the direction of covariation and the frequency ranges involved. We hypothesized that distinct phase-amplitude frequency pairs have differentiable contributions during tasks that manipulate spatial attention. We investigated this hypothesis with electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from participants who engaged in a cued spatial attention task. To understand the contribution of PAC to spatial attention we classified cortical sites by their relationship to spatial variables or behavioral performance. Local neural activity in spatial sites was sensitive to spatial variables in the task, while local neural activity in behavioral sites correlated with reaction time. We found two PAC frequency clusters that covaried with different aspects of the task. During a period of cued attention, delta-phase/high-gamma (DH) PAC was sensitive to cue direction in spatial sites. In contrast, theta-alpha-phase/beta-low-gamma-amplitude (TABL) PAC robustly correlated with future reaction times in behavioral sites. Finally, we investigated the origins of TABL PAC and found it corresponded to behaviorally relevant, sharp waveforms, which were also coupled to a low frequency rhythm. We conclude that TABL and DH PAC correspond to distinct mechanisms during spatial attention tasks and that sharp waveforms are elements of a coupled dynamical process.},

	abstract = {A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with neural activity remain under debate. Here, we revisit the mechanistic hypothesis that transient brain rhythms are a signature of metastable synchronization, occurring at reduced collective frequencies due to delays between brain areas. We consider a system of damped oscillators in the presence of background noise – approximating the short-lived gamma-frequency oscillations generated within neuronal circuits – coupled according to the diffusion weighted tractography between brain areas. Varying the global coupling strength and conduction speed, we identify a critical regime where spatially and spectrally resolved metastable oscillatory modes (MOMs) emerge at sub-gamma frequencies, approximating the MEG power spectra from 89 healthy individuals at rest. Further, we demonstrate that the frequency, duration, and scale of MOMs – as well as the frequency-specific envelope functional connectivity – can be controlled by global parameters, while the connectome structure remains unchanged. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, these numerical analyses demonstrate how interactions between locally generated fast oscillations in the connectome spacetime structure can lead to the emergence of collective brain rhythms organized in space and time.},

Cortical oscillations have been proposed as instruments of sensory de-multiplexing, i.e., the parallel processing of different frequency streams in sensory signals. Yet their causal role in such a process has never been demonstrated. Here, we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta–gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the syllabic rhythm and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding. These results demonstrate that cortical oscillations can be a key instrument of speech de-multiplexing, parsing, and encoding.},

However, the underlying circuit mechanism remains poorly understood and represents a major challenge in neuroscience. We approached this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intralaminar, interlaminar, interareal, and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, as well as providing insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas, including the observation that feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30 to 70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low-beta (8 to 15 Hz) oscillations. Furthermore, the model reproduces a functional hierarchy based on frequency-dependent Granger causality analysis of interareal signaling, as reported in recent monkey and human experiments, and suggests a mechanism for the observed context-dependent hierarchy dynamics. Together, this work highlights the necessity of multiscale approaches and provides a modeling platform for studies of large-scale brain circuit dynamics and functions.},

The power of high frequency (\&gt;30 Hz) oscillations in LFPs is locked to the phase of low frequency (\&lt;30 Hz) oscillations, an effect known as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). While PAC has been observed in a variety of cortical regions and animal models, its functional role particularly in primate visual cortex is largely unknown. Here, we document PAC for LFPs recorded from extra-striate area MT of macaque monkeys, an area specialized for the processing of visual motion. We further show that directing spatial attention into the receptive field of MT neurons decreases the coupling between the low frequency phase and high frequency power of LFPs. This attentional suppression of PAC increases neuronal discriminability for attended visual stimuli. Therefore, we hypothesize that visual cortex uses PAC to regulate inter-neuronal correlations and thereby enhances the coding of relevant stimuli.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Amplitude modulation (AM) is a temporal feature of most natural acoustic signals. A long psychophysical tradition has shown that AM is important in a variety of perceptual tasks, over a range of time scales. Technical possibilities in stimulus synthesis have reinvigorated this field and brought the modulation dimension back into focus. We address the question whether specialized neural mechanisms exist to extract AM information, and thus whether consideration of the modulation domain is essential in understanding the neural architecture of the auditory system. The available evidence suggests that this is the case. Peripheral neural structures not only transmit envelope information in the form of neural activity synchronized to the modulation waveform but are often tuned so that they only respond over a limited range of modulation frequencies. Ascending the auditory neuraxis, AM tuning persists but increasingly takes the form of tuning in average firing rate, rather than synchronization, to modulation frequency. There is a decrease in the highest modulation frequencies that influence the neural response, either in average rate or synchronization, as one records at higher and higher levels along the neuraxis. In parallel, there is an increasing tolerance of modulation tuning for other stimulus parameters such as sound pressure level, modulation depth, and type of carrier. At several anatomical levels, consideration of modulation response properties assists the prediction of neural responses to complex natural stimuli. Finally, some evidence exists for a topographic ordering of neurons according to modulation tuning. The picture that emerges is that temporal modulations are a critical stimulus attribute that assists us in the detection, discrimination, identification, parsing, and localization of acoustic sources and that this wide-ranging role is reflected in dedicated physiological properties at different anatomical levels.},

Indeed, neuroimaging atlases vary substantially regarding which thalamic nuclei are included and how their delineations were established. Here, we review current and emerging methods for thalamic nuclei segmentation in neuroimaging data and consider the limitations of existing techniques in terms of their research and clinical applicability. We address these challenges by proposing a roadmap to improve thalamic nuclei segmentation in human neuroimaging and, in turn, harmonize research approaches and advance clinical applications. We believe that a collective effort is required to achieve this. We hope that this will ultimately lead to the thalamic nuclei being regarded as key brain regions in their own right and not (as often currently assumed) as simply a gateway between cortical and subcortical regions.},

This evidence suggests that tau burden in this functional network could be a common imaging biomarker for prognostication across the syndromic spectrum of AD.Here, we examined the relationship between baseline tau PET signal and the rate of subsequent clinical decline in a sample of 48 A+/T+/N+ patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD with atypical clinical phenotypes: Posterior Cortical Atrophy (n = 16), logopenic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (n = 15), and amnestic syndrome with multi-domain impairment and young age of onset \&lt; 65 years (n = 17). All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), tau PET, and amyloid PET scans at baseline. Each patient’s longitudinal clinical decline was assessed by calculating the annualized change in the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) scores from baseline to follow-up (mean time interval = 14.55 ± 3.97 months).Atypical early AD patients showed an increase in CDR-SB by 1.18 ± 1.25 points per year: t(47) = 6.56, p \&lt; .001, Cohen’s d = 0.95. Across clinical phenotypes, baseline tau in the default mode network was the strongest predictor of clinical decline (R2 = .30), outperforming a simpler model with baseline clinical impairment and demographic variables (R2 = .10), tau in other functional networks (R2 = .11-.26), and the magnitude of cortical atrophy (R2 = .20) and amyloid burden (R2 = .09) in the default mode network.Overall, these findings point to the contribution of default mode network tau to predicting the magnitude of clinical decline in atypical early AD patients one year later. This simple measure could aid the development of a personalized prognostic, monitoring, and treatment plan, which would help clinicians not only predict the natural evolution of the disease but also estimate the effect of disease-modifying therapies on slowing subsequent clinical decline given the patient’s tau burden while still early in the disease course.},

In this study, we used high-resolution 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to derive a functional connectome encompassing cortex and 58 brainstem nuclei spanning the midbrain, pons and medulla. We identified a compact set of integrative hubs in the brainstem with widespread connectivity with cerebral cortex. Patterns of connectivity between brainstem and cerebral cortex manifest as neurophysiological oscillatory rhythms, patterns of cognitive functional specialization and the unimodal–transmodal functional hierarchy. This persistent alignment between cortical functional topographies and brainstem nuclei is shaped by the spatial arrangement of multiple neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. We replicated all findings using 3-Tesla data from the same participants. Collectively, this work demonstrates that multiple organizational features of cortical activity can be traced back to the brainstem.},

	abstract = {I argue that the sample complexity of (biological, feedforward) object recognition is mostly due to geometric image transformations and conjecture that a main goal of the ventral stream – V1, V2, V4 and IT – is to learn-and-discount image transformations.In the first part of the paper I describe a class of simple and biologically plausible memory-based modules that learn transformations from unsupervised visual experience. The main theorems show that these modules provide (for every object) a signature which is invariant to local affine transformations and approximately invariant for other transformations. I also prove that,in a broad class of hierarchical architectures, signatures remain invariant from layer to layer. The identification of these memory-based modules with complex (and simple) cells in visual areas leads to a theory of invariant recognition for the ventral stream.In the second part, I outline a theory about hierarchical architectures that can learn invariance to transformations. I show that the memory complexity of learning affine transformations is drastically reduced in a hierarchical architecture that factorizes transformations in terms of the subgroup of translations and the subgroups of rotations and scalings. I then show how translations are automatically selected as the only learnable transformations during development by enforcing small apertures – eg small receptive fields – in the first layer.In a third part I show that the transformations represented in each area can be optimized in terms of storage and robustness, as a consequence determining the tuning of the neurons in the area, rather independently (under normal conditions) of the statistics of natural images. I describe a model of learning that can be proved to have this property, linking in an elegant way the spectral properties of the signatures with the tuning of receptive fields in different areas. A surprising implication of these theoretical results is that the computational goals and some of the tuning properties of cells in the ventral stream may follow from symmetry properties (in the sense of physics) of the visual world through a process of unsupervised correlational learning, based on Hebbian synapses. In particular, simple and complex cells do not directly care about oriented bars: their tuning is a side effect of their role in translation invariance. Across the whole ventral stream the preferred features reported for neurons in different areas are only a symptom of the invariances computed and represented.The results of each of the three parts stand on their own independently of each other. Together this theory-in-fieri makes several broad predictions, some of which are:-invariance to small transformations in early areas (eg translations in V1) may underly stability of visual perception (suggested by Stu Geman);-each cell’s tuning properties are shaped by visual experience of image transformations during developmental and adult plasticity;-simple cells are likely to be the same population as complex cells, arising from different convergence of the Hebbian learning rule. The input to complex “complex” cells are dendritic branches with simple cell properties;-class-specific transformations are learned and represented at the top of the ventral stream hierarchy; thus class-specific modules such as faces, places and possibly body areas should exist in IT;-the type of transformations that are learned from visual experience depend on the size of the receptive fields and thus on the area (layer in the models) – assuming that the size increases with layers;-the mix of transformations learned in each area influences the tuning properties of the cells oriented bars in V1+V2, radial and spiral patterns in V4 up to class specific tuning in AIT (eg face tuned cells);-features must be discriminative and invariant: invariance to transformations is the primary determinant of the tuning of cortical neurons rather than statistics of natural images.The theory is broadly consistent with the current version of HMAX. It explains it and extend it in terms of unsupervised learning, a broader class of transformation invariance and higher level modules. The goal of this paper is to sketch a comprehensive theory with little regard for mathematical niceties. If the theory turns out to be useful there will be scope for deep mathematics, ranging from group representation tools to wavelet theory to dynamics of learning.},

	abstract = {When trying to fit a deep neural network (DNN) to a G-invariant target function with G a group, it only makes sense to constrain the DNN to be G-invariant as well. However, there can be many different ways to do this, thus raising the problem of “G-invariant neural architecture design”: What is the optimal G-invariant architecture for a given problem? Before we can consider the optimization problem itself, we must understand the search space, the architectures in it, and how they relate to one another. In this paper, we take a first step towards this goal; we prove a theorem that gives a classification of all G-invariant single-hidden-layer or “shallow” neural network (G-SNN) architectures with ReLU activation for any finite orthogonal group G, and we prove a second theorem that characterizes the inclusion maps or “network morphisms” between the architectures that can be leveraged during neural architecture search (NAS). The proof is based on a correspondence of every G-SNN to a signed permutation representation of G acting on the hidden neurons; the classification is equivalently given in terms of the first cohomology classes of G, thus admitting a topological interpretation. The G-SNN architectures corresponding to nontrivial cohomology classes have, to our knowledge, never been explicitly identified in the literature previously. Using a code implementation, we enumerate the G-SNN architectures for some example groups G and visualize their structure. Finally, we prove that architectures corresponding to inequivalent cohomology classes coincide in function space only when their weight matrices are zero, and we discuss the implications of this for NAS.},

In this paper, we present a method to extract symmetries learned by a neural network and to evaluate the degree to which a network is invariant to them. With our method, we are able to explicitly retrieve learned invariances in a form of the generators of corresponding Lie-groups without prior knowledge of symmetries in the data. We use the proposed method to study how symmetrical properties depend on a neural network's parameterization and configuration. We found that the ability of a network to learn symmetries generalizes over a range of architectures. However, the quality of learned symmetries depends on the depth and the number of parameters.},

	title = {A unified framework to enforce, discover, and promote symmetry in machine learning},
	abstract = {Symmetry is present throughout nature and continues to play an increasingly central role in physics and machine learning. Fundamental symmetries, such as Poincaré invariance, allow physical laws discovered in laboratories on Earth to be extrapolated to the farthest reaches of the universe. Symmetry is essential to achieving this extrapolatory power in machine learning applications. For example, translation invariance in image classification allows models with fewer parameters, such as convolutional neural networks, to be trained on smaller data sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a unifying theoretical and methodological framework for incorporating symmetry into machine learning models in three ways: 1. enforcing known symmetry when training a model; 2. discovering unknown symmetries of a given model or data set; and 3. promoting symmetry during training by learning a model that breaks symmetries within a user-specified group of candidates when there is sufficient evidence in the data. We show that these tasks can be cast within a common mathematical framework whose central object is the Lie derivative associated with fiber-linear Lie group actions on vector bundles. We extend and unify several existing results by showing that enforcing and discovering symmetry are linear-algebraic tasks that are dual with respect to the bilinear structure of the Lie derivative. We also propose a novel way to promote symmetry by introducing a class of convex regularization functions based on the Lie derivative and nuclear norm relaxation to penalize symmetry breaking during training of machine learning models. We explain how these ideas can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models including basis function regression, dynamical systems discovery, multilayer perceptrons, and neural networks acting on spatial fields such as images.},

	abstract = {Data-driven transformations that reformulate nonlinear systems in a linear framework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work, we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power. We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is demonstrated that these eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including 1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a variety of Hamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean mixing.},

We take as a premise that “there is experience” and focus on the requirements for structured experience ([Formula: see text]) — the spatial, temporal, and conceptual organization of our first-person experience of the world and of ourselves as agents in it. Our starting point is the insight that access to good models — succinct and accurate generative programs of world data — is crucial for homeostasis and survival. We hypothesize that the successful comparison of such models with data provides the structure to experience. Building on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, we can associate the qualitative aspects of [Formula: see text] with the algorithmic features of the model, including its length, which reflects the structure discovered in the data. Moreover, a modeling system tracking structured data will display dimensionality reduction and criticality features that can be used empirically to quantify the structure of the program run by the agent. KT provides a consistent framework to define the concepts of life and agent and allows for the comparison between artificial agents and [Formula: see text]-reporting humans to provide an educated guess about agent experience. A first challenge is to show that a human agent has [Formula: see text] to the extent they run encompassing and compressive models tracking world data. For this, we propose to study the relation between the structure of neurophenomenological, physiological, and behavioral data. The second is to endow artificial agents with the means to discover good models and study their internal states and behavior.

	abstract = {Providing objective metrics of conscious state is of great interest across multiple research and clinical fields-from neurology to artificial intelligence. Here we approach this challenge by proposing plausible mechanisms for the phenomenon of structured experience. In earlier work, we argued that the experience we call reality is a mental construct derived from information compression. Here we show that algorithmic information theory provides a natural framework to study and quantify consciousness from neurophysiological or neuroimaging data, given the premise that the primary role of the brain is information processing. We take as an axiom that "there is consciousness" and focus on the requirements for structured experience: we hypothesize that the existence and use of compressive models by cognitive systems, e.g. in biological recurrent neural networks, enables and provides the structure to phenomenal experience. Self-awareness is seen to arise naturally (as part of a better model) in cognitive systems interacting bidirectionally with the external world. Furthermore, we argue that by running such models to track data, brains can give rise to apparently complex (entropic but hierarchically organized) data. We compare this theory, named KT for its basis on the mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity, to other information-centric theories of consciousness. We then describe methods to study the complexity of the brain's output streams or of brain state as correlates of conscious state: we review methods such as (i) probing the brain through its input streams (e.g. event-related potentials in oddball paradigms or mutual algorithmic information between world and brain), (ii) analyzing spontaneous brain state, (iii) perturbing the brain by non-invasive transcranial stimulation, and (iv) quantifying behavior (e.g. eye movements or body sway).},

	abstract = {Serotonergic psychedelics have been identified as promising next-generation therapeutic agents in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders. While their efficacy has been increasingly validated, the mechanism by which they exert a therapeutic effect is still debated. A popular theoretical account is that excessive 5-HT2a agonism disrupts cortical dynamics, relaxing the precision of maladaptive high-level beliefs and making them more malleable and open to revision. We extend this perspective by developing a simple energy-based model of cortical dynamics based on predictive processing which incorporates effects of neuromodulation. Using this model, we propose and simulate hypothetical computational mechanisms for both 5-HT2a and 5-HT1a agonism. Results from our model are able to account for a number of existing empirical observations concerning serotonergic psychedelics effects on cognition and affect. Using the findings of our model, we provide a theoretically-grounded hypothesis for the clinical success of LSD, psilocybin, and DMT, as well as identify the design space of biased 5-HT1a agonist psychedelics such as 5-MeO-DMT as potentially fruitful in the development of more effective and tolerable psychotherapeutic agents in the future.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the relevance of simplicity and its formal representation as Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity in the cognitive sciences. The discussion is based on two premises: 1) all human experience is generated in the brain, 2) the brain has only access to information. Taken together, these two premises lead us to conclude that all the elements of what we call `reality' are derived mental constructs based on information and compression, i.e., algorithmic models derived from the search for simplicity in data. Naturally, these premises apply to humans in real or virtual environments as well as robots or other cognitive systems. Based on this, it is further hypothesized that there is a hierarchy of processing levels where simplicity and compression play a major role. As applications, I illustrate first the relevance of compression and simplicity in fundamental neuroscience with an analysis of the Mismatch Negativity paradigm. Then I discuss the applicability to Presence research, which studies how to produce real-feeling experiences in mediated interaction, and use Bayesian modeling to define in a formal way different aspects of the illusion of Presence. The idea is put forth that given alternative models (interpretations) for a given mediated interaction, a brain will select the simplest one it can construct weighted by prior models. In the final section the universality of these ideas and applications in robotics, machine learning, biology and education is discussed. I emphasize that there is a common conceptual thread based on the idea of simplicity, which suggests a common study approach.},

Recent advances have introduced tools to characterise emergent macroscopic levels; however, while these approaches are successful in identifying when emergence takes place, they are limited in the extent they can determine how it does. Here we address this limitation by developing a computational approach to emergence, which characterises macroscopic processes in terms of their computational capabilities. Concretely, we articulate a view on emergence based on how software works, which is rooted on a mathematical formalism that articulates how macroscopic processes can express self-contained informational, interventional, and computational properties. This framework establishes a hierarchy of nested self-contained processes that determines what computations take place at what level, which in turn delineates the functional architecture of a complex system. This approach is illustrated on paradigmatic models from the statistical physics and computational neuroscience literature, which are shown to exhibit macroscopic processes that are akin to software in human-engineered systems. Overall, this framework enables a deeper understanding of the multi-level structure of complex systems, revealing specific ways in which they can be efficiently simulated, predicted, and controlled.},

Prior NIBS-meditation research has predominantly targeted frontal and parietal cortices suggesting that it might be possible to boost the behavioral and neural effects of meditation with NIBS. Moreover, NIBS has revealed distinct neural signatures in long-term meditators. Nonetheless, methodological variations in NIBS-meditation research contributes to challenges for definitive interpretation of previous results. Future NIBS studies should further investigate core substrates of meditation, including specific brain networks and oscillations, and causal neural mechanisms of advanced meditation.

	abstract = {Background
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to improve various forms of learning in humans. Stimulation is often applied during training, producing lasting enhancements that are specific to the learned task. These learning effects are thought to be mediated by altered synaptic plasticity. However, the effects of DCS during the induction of endogenous synaptic plasticity remain largely unexplored.
Objective/Hypothesis
Here we are interested in the effects of DCS applied during synaptic plasticity induction.
Methods
To model endogenous plasticity we induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) at Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. Anodal and cathodal DCS at 20 V/m were applied throughout plasticity induction in both apical and basal dendritic compartments.
Results
When DCS was paired with concurrent plasticity induction, the resulting plasticity was biased towards potentiation, such that LTP was enhanced and LTD was reduced. Remarkably, both anodal and cathodal stimulation can produce this bias, depending on the dendritic location and type of plasticity induction. Cathodal DCS enhanced LTP in apical dendrites while anodal DCS enhanced LTP in basal dendrites. Both anodal and cathodal DCS reduced LTD in apical dendrites. DCS did not affect synapses that were weakly active or when NMDA receptors were blocked.
Conclusions
These results highlight the role of DCS as a modulator, rather than inducer of synaptic plasticity, as well as the dependence of DCS effects on the spatial and temporal properties of endogenous synaptic activity. The relevance of the present results to human tDCS should be validated in future studies.},

Despite promising results, the clinical efficacy of tDCS is still under debate and researchers and clinicians try to maximize efficacy by developing optimized/individualized protocols. In this randomized sham-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, we optimized a stimulation protocol for increasing and decreasing activity in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). 60 patients with major depression were recruited and randomly assigned to active conventional tDCS (N=20), active multichannel tDCS (N=20), or sham tDCS (N=20) groups. Patients in each group received 30 sessions of active or sham tDCS for 5 days per week. In the multichannel optimized tDCS, electrical current was delivered via 7 small electrodes (11 mm in diameter) with 2 mA intensity with a maximum total injected current set to 4.0 mA. In the conventional tDCS (2 mA intensity, electrode size of 35 cm2) and sham Tdcs, anodal and cathodal electrodes were placed over the left and right DLPFC respectively. Symptoms severity (measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale- HDRS, Beck Depression Inventory- BDI-II, and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale- MADRS) were assessed before the intervention, after sessions 10th, 20th, and right after the intervention (session 30th), and 1 and 3 months following the intervention. Compared to the sham group, both active tDCS groups significantly reduced depressive symptoms up to 3 months following the intervention, and the therapeutic effects were observed from session 10th only in the multichannel tDCS groups. Furthermore, the effect size from the optimized multichannel protocol was significantly larger than the conventional tDCS. These data suggest that optimized multichannel tDCS might maximize therapeutic efficacy in major depression.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Proof-of-principle human studies suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may improve depression severity. This open-label multicenter study tested remotely supervised multichannel tDCS delivered at home in patients (N=35) with major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary aim was to assess the feasibility and safety of our protocol. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated therapeutic efficacy: the primary efficacy measure was the median percent change from baseline to the end of the 4-week post-treatment follow-up period in the observer-rated Montgomery-Asberg Depression Mood Rating Scale (MADRS).
METHODS: Participants received 37 at-home stimulation sessions (30 minutes each) of specifically designed multichannel tDCS targeting the left DLPFC administered over eight weeks (4 weeks of daily treatments plus 4 weeks of taper), with a follow-up period of 4 weeks following the final stimulation session. The stimulation montage (electrode positions and currents) was optimized by employing computational models of the electric field generated by multichannel tDCS using available structural data from a similar population (group optimization). Conducted entirely remotely, the study employed the MADRS for assessment at baseline, at weeks 4 and 8 during treatment, and at 4-week follow-up visits.
RESULTS: 34 patients (85.3\% women) with a mean age of 59 years, a diagnosis of MDD according to DSM-5 criteria, and a MADRS score ≥20 at the time of study enrolment completed all study visits. At baseline, the mean time since MDD diagnosis was 24.0 (SD 19.1) months. Concerning compliance, 85\% of the participants (n=29) completed the complete course of 37 stimulation sessions at home, while 97\% completed at least 36 sessions. No detrimental effects were observed, including suicidal ideation and/or behavior. The study observed a median MADRS score reduction of 64.5\% (48.6, 72.4) 4 weeks post-treatment (Hedge's g = -3.1). We observed a response rate (≥ 50\% improvement in MADRS scores) of 72.7\% (n=24) from baseline to the last visit 4 weeks post-treatment. Secondary measures reflected similar improvements.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that remotely supervised and supported multichannel home-based tDCS is safe and feasible, and antidepressant efficacy motivates further appropriately controlled clinical studies.},

By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.},

This manifold perspective enables blind discovery and decoding of the represented variable using only neural population activity (without knowledge of the input, output, behavior or topography). We characterize and directly visualize manifold structure in the mammalian head direction circuit, revealing that the states form a topologically nontrivial one-dimensional ring. The ring exhibits isometry and is invariant across waking and rapid eye movement sleep. This result directly demonstrates that there are continuous attractor dynamics and enables powerful inference about mechanism.

Using volumetric lightsheet imaging, we find a topographical representation of heading direction in a neuronal network in the zebrafish anterior hindbrain, where a sinusoidal bump of activity rotates following directional swims of the fish and is otherwise stable over many seconds. Electron microscopy reconstructions show that, although the cell bodies are located in a dorsal region, these neurons arborize in the interpeduncular nucleus, where reciprocal inhibitory connectivity stabilizes the ring attractor network that encodes heading. These neurons resemble those found in the fly central complex, showing that similar circuit architecture principles may underlie the representation of heading direction across the animal kingdom and paving the way to an unprecedented mechanistic understanding of these networks in vertebrates.},

We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics.

Grid cells, a key component of this system, fire in a characteristic hexagonal pattern of locations2, and are organized in modules3 that collectively form a population code for the animal’s allocentric position1. The invariance of the correlation structure of this population code across environments4,5 and behavioural states6,7, independent of specific sensory inputs, has pointed to intrinsic, recurrently connected continuous attractor networks (CANs) as a possible substrate of the grid pattern1,8–11. However, whether grid cell networks show continuous attractor dynamics, and how they interface with inputs from the environment, has remained unclear owing to the small samples of cells obtained so far. Here, using simultaneous recordings from many hundreds of grid cells and subsequent topological data analysis, we show that the joint activity of grid cells from an individual module resides on a toroidal manifold, as expected in a two-dimensional CAN. Positions on the torus correspond to positions of the moving animal in the environment. Individual cells are preferentially active at singular positions on the torus. Their positions are maintained between environments and from wakefulness to sleep, as predicted by CAN models for grid cells but not by alternative feedforward models12. This demonstration of network dynamics on a toroidal manifold provides a population-level visualization of CAN dynamics in grid cells.},

	abstract = {There is rich variety in the activity of single neurons recorded during behaviour. Yet, these diverse single neuron responses can be well described by relatively few patterns of neural co-modulation. The study of such low-dimensional structure of neural population activity has provided important insights into how the brain generates behaviour. Virtually all of these studies have used linear dimensionality reduction techniques to estimate these population-wide co-modulation patterns, constraining them to a flat “neural manifold”. Here, we hypothesised that since neurons have nonlinear responses and make thousands of distributed and recurrent connections that likely amplify such nonlinearities, neural manifolds should be intrinsically nonlinear. Combining neural population recordings from monkey, mouse, and human motor cortex, and mouse striatum, we show that: 1) neural manifolds are intrinsically nonlinear; 2) their nonlinearity becomes more evident during complex tasks that require more varied activity patterns; and 3) manifold nonlinearity varies across architecturally distinct brain regions. Simulations using recurrent neural network models confirmed the proposed relationship between circuit connectivity and manifold nonlinearity, including the differences across architecturally distinct regions. Thus, neural manifolds underlying the generation of behaviour are inherently nonlinear, and properly accounting for such nonlinearities will be critical as neuroscientists move towards studying numerous brain regions involved in increasingly complex and naturalistic behaviours.},

Our model uses neuronal activity to predict expected time of future motor commands up to 30 s prior to the event. These motor commands control locomotion. Predictions are valid for individuals not used in model construction. The model predicts dwell time statistics, sequences of motor commands and individual neuron activation. To develop this model, we extracted loops spanned by neuronal activity in phase space using novel methodology. The model uses only two variables: the identity of the loop and the phase along it. Current values of these macroscopic variables predict future neuronal activity. Remarkably, our model based on macroscopic variables succeeds despite consistent inter-individual differences in neuronal activation. Thus, our analytical framework reconciles consistent individual differences in neuronal activation with macroscopic dynamics that operate universally across individuals.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in experimental neuroscience make it possible to simultaneously record the activity of thousands of neurons. However, the development of analysis approaches for such large-scale neural recordings have been slower than those applicable to single-cell experiments. One approach that has gained recent popularity is neural manifold learning. This approach takes advantage of the fact that often, even though neural datasets may be very high dimensional, the dynamics of neural activity tends to traverse a much lower-dimensional space. The topological structures formed by these low-dimensional neural subspaces are referred to as “neural manifolds”, and may potentially provide insight linking neural circuit dynamics with cognitive function and behavioral performance. In this paper we review a number of linear and non-linear approaches to neural manifold learning, including principal component analysis (PCA), multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), Isomap, locally linear embedding (LLE), Laplacian eigenmaps (LEM), t-SNE, and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). We outline these methods under a common mathematical nomenclature, and compare their advantages and disadvantages with respect to their use for neural data analysis. We apply them to a number of datasets from published literature, comparing the manifolds that result from their application to hippocampal place cells, motor cortical neurons during a reaching task, and prefrontal cortical neurons during a multi-behavior task. We find that in many circumstances linear algorithms produce similar results to non-linear methods, although in particular cases where the behavioral complexity is greater, non-linear methods tend to find lower-dimensional manifolds, at the possible expense of interpretability. We demonstrate that these methods are applicable to the study of neurological disorders through simulation of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease, and speculate that neural manifold analysis may help us to understand the circuit-level consequences of molecular and cellular neuropathology.},

	abstract = {Transcriptomic profiles are important indicators for molecular mechanisms and pathways involved in major depressive disorder (MDD) and its different phenotypes, such as immunometabolic depression. We performed whole-transcriptome and pathway analyses on 139 individuals from the observational, case-control, BIOmarkers in DEPression (BIODEP) study, 105 with MDD and 34 controls. We divided MDD participants based on levels of inflammation, as measured by serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), in n = 39 ‘not inflamed’ (CRP {\textless} 1 mg/L), n = 31 with ‘elevated CRP’ (1–3 mg/L), and n = 35 with ‘low-grade inflammation’ ({\textgreater}3 mg/L). We performed whole-blood RNA sequencing using Illumina NextSeq 550 and statistical analyses with the Deseq2 package for R statistics (RUV-corrected) and subsequent pathway analyses with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Immunometabolic pathways were activated in individuals with CRP {\textgreater} 1 mg/L, although surprisingly the CRP 1–3 group showed stronger immune activation than the CRP {\textgreater} 3 group. The main pathways identified in the comparison between CRP {\textless} 1 group and controls were cell-cycle-related, which may be protective against immunometabolic abnormalities in this ‘non-inflamed’ depressed group. We further divided MDD participants based on exposure and response to antidepressants (n = 47 non-responders, n = 37 responders, and n = 22 unmedicated), and identified specific immunomodulatory and neuroprotective pathways in responders (especially vs. non-responders), which could be relevant to treatment response. In further subgroup analyses, we found that the specific transcriptional profile of responders is independent of CRP levels, and that the inhibition of cell-cycle-related pathways in MDD with CRP {\textless} 1 mg/L is present only in those who are currently depressed, and not in the responders. The present study demonstrates immunometabolic and cell-cycle-related transcriptomic pathways associated with MDD and different (CRP-based and treatment-based) MDD phenotypes, while shedding light on potential molecular mechanisms that could prevent or facilitate an individual’s trajectory toward immunometabolic depression and/or treatment-non-responsive depression. The recognition and integration of these mechanisms will facilitate a precision-medicine approach in MDD.},

Current knowledge about the neural underpinnings of this cognitive process in humans stems from functional neuroimaging research1–5. As these methods lack direct access to the neuronal level, it remains unknown how this process is computed by neurons in the human brain. Here we record from single neurons in individuals who have been implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons, and show that human hippocampal and entorhinal neurons gradually modify their activity to encode the temporal structure of a complex image presentation sequence. This representation was formed rapidly, without providing specific instructions to the participants, and persisted when the prescribed experience was no longer present. Furthermore, the structure recovered from the population activity of hippocampal–entorhinal neurons closely resembled the structural graph defining the sequence, but at the same time, also reflected the probability of upcoming stimuli. Finally, learning of the sequence graph was related to spontaneous, time-compressed replay of individual neurons’ activity corresponding to previously experienced graph trajectories. These findings demonstrate that neurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex integrate the ‘what’ and ‘when’ information to extract durable and predictive representations of the temporal structure of human experience.},

Further distinction can be drawn between past-centered traumatic recurrences and present-centered trauma-related intrusions. While some argue sensorimotor representations to be building blocks of all memory forms, traumatic memory seems to haunt in the form of unintegrated sensations and actions. This Perspective hypothesizes a neurobiological delineation between these memory forms, where traumatic memory is uniquely characterized by alterations to lower-level and primary sensorimotor processes. The proposed demarcation has implications for legal systems, which assume interrogations of autobiographical and traumatic memory can be methodologically identical. Clinically, first-line treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder have yet to explicitly address sensorimotor processes, where up to half of individuals are non-responsive and 20\% drop out. We are left with urgent needs to consider sensorimotor fragmentation of traumatic memory and advance interventions that assimilate these fragments into a past-contextualized autobiography.},

Active inference is a theory that explains how sentient creatures are able to act adaptively and appropriately in their shared ecological niche—and how they change the niche to fit their expectations. In particular, we consider three recent bodies of work in the variational tradition and examine their implications for the study of conscious experience. We argue that these bodies of work provide the foundation for an active inference theory of conscious experience. This theory, hierarchical or deep neurophenomenology, extends the notion of (neural) hermeneutics to systems beyond the brain, crucially including the shared ecological niche. By emphasizing the importance of taking hierarchical spatial scales into consideration, deep hermeneutics is compatible with, but does not entail, the thesis of extended consciousness. Moreover, by focusing on multiple temporal scales, the theory provides the conceptual resources for understanding the puzzling features of time consciousness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been explored in epilepsy with limited samples, varied parameters, and inconclusive results. We aimed to study the efficacy of tDCS for patients with refractory focal epilepsy.
METHOD: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, and three-arm (Group 1 (sham), Group 2 (20-min), and Group 3 (2 × 20-min)) tDCS parallel multicenter study. The primary outcome measurement was seizure frequencies (SFs). The study consisted of 28-days baseline, 14-days treatment, and 56-days follow-up. The cathode was placed over the epileptogenic focus, and the current intensity was 2 mA. The generalized estimating equations model, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 82 enrolled patients, 70 patients were included for final analysis (Group 1, n = 21; Group 2, n = 24; and Group 3, n = 25). There was a significant reduction in SFs for both active tDCS groups compared with the sham group. Patients in Group 2 showed a significantly 50.73-21.91\% greater reduction in SFs that lasted for 4 weeks (p = 0.008-0.060). Patients in Group 3 showed a significantly 63.19-49.79\% greater reduction in SFs compared with the sham group that lasted for 5 weeks (p = 0.011-0.045). Patients in Group 3 had a 64.98-66.32\% greater reduction in SFs at W9-W10, when compared with Group 2 (p = 0.021-0.022).
CONCLUSION: Fourteen consecutive days tDCS significantly decreased SFs in patients with refractory focal epilepsy, with 2 × 20-min daily stimulation protocol being superior to 20-min daily stimulation protocol.},

	abstract = {Understanding how brains process information is an incredibly difficult task. Amongst the metrics characterising information processing in the brain, observations of dynamic near-critical states have generated significant interest. However, theoretical and experimental limitations associated with human and animal models have precluded a definite answer about when and why neural criticality arises with links from attention, to cognition, and even to consciousness. To explore this topic, we used an in vitro neural network of cortical neurons that was trained to play a simplified game of ‘Pong’ to demonstrate Synthetic Biological Intelligence (SBI). We demonstrate that critical dynamics emerge when neural networks receive task-related structured sensory input, reorganizing the system to a near-critical state. Additionally, better task performance correlated with proximity to critical dynamics. However, criticality alone is insufficient for a neuronal network to demonstrate learning in the absence of additional information regarding the consequences of previous actions. These findings offer compelling support that neural criticality arises as a base feature of incoming structured information processing without the need for higher order cognition.},

We deprived male rats of experience with crucial features of Euclidean geometry by rearing them inside spheres, and compared activity of large hippocampal neuronal ensembles during navigation and sleep with that of cuboid cage-reared controls. Sphere-rearing from birth permitted emergence of accurate neuronal ensemble spatial codes and preconfigured and plastic time-compressed neuronal sequences. However, sphere-rearing led to diminished individual place cell tuning, more similar neuronal mapping of different track ends/corners, and impaired pattern separation and plasticity of multiple linear tracks, coupled with reduced preconfigured sleep network repertoires. Subsequent experience with multiple linear environments over four days largely reversed these effects. Thus, early-life experience with Euclidean geometry enriches the hippocampal repertoire of preconfigured neuronal patterns selected toward unique representation and discrimination of multiple linear environments.},

	abstract = {Time-series forecasting is a challenging task that traditionally requires specialized models custom-trained for the specific task at hand. Recently, inspired by the success of large language models, foundation models pre-trained on vast amounts of time-series data from diverse domains have emerged as a promising candidate for general-purpose time-series forecasting. The defining characteristic of these foundation models is their ability to perform zero-shot learning, that is, forecasting a new system from limited context data without explicit re-training or fine-tuning. Here, we evaluate whether the zero-shot learning paradigm extends to the challenging task of forecasting chaotic systems. Across 135 distinct chaotic dynamical systems and \$10{\textasciicircum}8\$ timepoints, we find that foundation models produce competitive forecasts compared to custom-trained models (including NBEATS, TiDE, etc.), particularly when training data is limited. Interestingly, even after point forecasts fail, foundation models preserve the geometric and statistical properties of the chaotic attractors, demonstrating a surprisingly strong ability to capture the long-term behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight the promises and pitfalls of foundation models in making zero-shot forecasts of chaotic systems.},

	abstract = {An auditory object is a perceptual construct, corresponding to the sound that can be assigned to a particular acoustic source. An auditory object spans acoustic events that unfold over time, and a sequence of objects forms a 'stream': for example, when a person is walking, the sound of each step is a unique auditory object but the temporal sequence of footsteps is linked together to form a stream.An auditory object is constructed from the spectrotemporal regularities in the acoustic environment. More specifically, an auditory stimulus comes into our awareness as a sound as a result of the simultaneous and sequential principles that group the acoustic features of the auditory stimulus into stable spectrotemporal entities.Auditory-object processing occurs in the cortex. In particular, the ventral auditory pathway mediates the computations underlying a listener's ability to perceive a sound (auditory object), whereas object-related information that is found in the dorsal pathway is used in the pursuit of audiomotor behaviours.Neural correlates of the perception of an auditory object are found in the auditory cortex. Whereas some studies indicate that the ventral pathway contains brain regions specialized for auditory-object processing, auditory perception is most likely to be mediated by a broad network of brain areas in this pathway.A hallmark of auditory-object processing is that it can be influenced by attention and that attention can act on the object itself and not the lower-level spectrotemporal details of the auditory stimulus. Both single-unit and functional imaging studies demonstrate the effects of attention on the representation of auditory objects in the auditory cortex.},

We also found that the IT population better predicts human performance patterns across properties. A hierarchical neural network model based on simple computational principles generates these same cross-area patterns of information. Taken together, our empirical results support the hypothesis that all behaviorally relevant object properties are extracted in concert up the ventral visual hierarchy, and our computational model explains how that hierarchy might be built.},

I review here recent evidence from human imaging and monkey neurophysiology studies to highlight the role of PPC in adaptive visual processing. I first document the diverse array of visual representations found in PPC. I then describe the adaptive nature of visual representation in PPC by contrasting visual processing in OTC and PPC and by showing that visual representations in PPC largely originate from OTC.},

In the last decades, several theories have suggested different accounts for these relationships. These theories have developed in parallel, with little to no cross-talk among them. To advance research on consciousness, we established an adversarial collaboration between proponents of two of the major theories in the field, Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory. Together, we devised and preregistered two experiments that test contrasting predictions of these theories concerning the location and timing of correlates of visual consciousness, which have been endorsed by the theories’ proponents. Predicted outcomes should either support, refute, or challenge these theories. Six theory-impartial laboratories will follow the study protocol specified here, using three complementary methods: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magneto-Electroencephalography (M-EEG), and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The study protocol will include built-in replications, both between labs and within datasets.

	abstract = {Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has begun to uncover the processes underlying increasingly complex voluntary behaviours, including learning and decision-making. Partly this success has been possible by progressing from simple experimental tasks to paradigms that incorporate more ecological features. More specifically, the premise is that to understand cognitions and brain functions relevant for real life, we need to introduce some of the ecological challenges that we have evolved to solve. This often entails an increase in task complexity, which can be managed by using computational models to help parse complex behaviours into specific component mechanisms. Here we propose that using computational models with tasks that capture ecologically relevant learning and decision-making processes may provide a critical advantage for capturing the mechanisms underlying symptoms of disorders in psychiatry. As a result, it may help develop mechanistic approaches towards diagnosis and treatment. We begin this review by mapping out the basic concepts and models of learning and decision-making. We then move on to consider specific challenges that emerge in realistic environments and describe how they can be captured by tasks. These include changes of context, uncertainty, reflexive/emotional biases, cost-benefit decision-making, and balancing exploration and exploitation. Where appropriate we highlight future or current links to psychiatry. We particularly draw examples from research on clinical depression, a disorder that greatly compromises motivated behaviours in real-life, but where simpler paradigms have yielded mixed results. Finally, we highlight several paradigms that could be used to help provide new insights into the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.},

This software individual, or "agent," is endowed with distinct emotional/affective, cognitive/deliberative, and social modules. Grounded in contemporary neuroscience, these internal components interact to generate observed, often far-from-rational, individual behavior. When multiple agents of this new type move and interact spatially, they collectively generate an astonishing range of dynamics spanning the fields of social conflict, psychology, public health, law, network science, and economics.Epstein weaves a computational tapestry with threads from Plato, Hume, Darwin, Pavlov, Smith, Tolstoy, Marx, James, and Dostoevsky, among others. This transformative synthesis of social philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, and agent-based modeling will fascinate scholars and students of every stripe. Epstein's computer programs are provided in the book or on its Princeton University Press website, along with movies of his "computational parables." Agent Zero is a signal departure in what it includes (e.g., a new synthesis of neurally grounded internal modules), what it eschews (e.g., standard behavioral imitation), the phenomena it generates (from genocide to financial panic), and the modeling arsenal it offers the scientific community.

	abstract = {Homeostasis is a central pillar of modern Physiology. The term homeostasis was invented by Walter Bradford Cannon in an attempt to extend and codify the principle of ‘milieu intérieur,’ or a constant interior bodily environment, that had previously been postulated by Claude Bernard. Clearly, ‘milieu intérieur’ and homeostasis have served us well for over a century. Nevertheless, research on signal transduction systems that regulate gene expression, or that cause biochemical alterations to existing enzymes, in response to external and internal stimuli makes it clear that biological systems are continuously making short-term adaptations both to set-points, and to the range of ‘normal’ capacity. These transient adaptations typically occur in response to relatively mild changes in conditions, to programs of exercise training, or to sub-toxic, non-damaging levels of chemical agents; thus the terms hormesis, heterostasis, and allostasis are not accurate descriptors. Therefore, an operational adjustment to our understanding of homeostasis suggests that the modified term, Adaptive Homeostasis may be useful especially in studies of stress, toxicology, disease, and aging. Adaptive Homeostasis may be defined as follows: ‘The transient expansion or contraction of the homeostatic range in response to exposure to sub-toxic, non-damaging, signaling molecules or events, or the removal or cessation of such molecules or events.”},

Serotonin 2a (5-HT2a) receptor agonism by these compounds is associated with more diverse (entropic) brain activity. We postulate that this increase in entropy may arise in part from a flattening of the brain’s control energy landscape, which can be observed using network control theory to quantify the energy required to transition between recurrent brain states. Using brain states derived from existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, we show that LSD and psilocybin reduce control energy required for brain state transitions compared to placebo. Furthermore, across individuals, reduction in control energy correlates with more frequent state transitions and increased entropy of brain state dynamics. Through network control analysis that incorporates the spatial distribution of 5-HT2a receptors (obtained from publicly available positron emission tomography (PET) data under non-drug conditions), we demonstrate an association between the 5-HT2a receptor and reduced control energy. Our findings provide evidence that 5-HT2a receptor agonist compounds allow for more facile state transitions and more temporally diverse brain activity. More broadly, we demonstrate that receptor-informed network control theory can model the impact of neuropharmacological manipulation on brain activity dynamics.},

On one influential account, cognition evolved to co-ordinate behaviour with environmental change or complexity (Godfrey-Smith in Complexity and the function of mind in nature, Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Biology, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996). Liberal interpretations of this view ascribe cognition to an extraordinarily broad set of biological systems—even bacteria, which modulate their activity in response to salient external cues, would seem to qualify as cognitive agents. However, equating cognition with adaptive flexibility per se glosses over important distinctions in the way biological organisms deal with environmental complexity. Drawing on contemporary advances in theoretical biology and computational neuroscience, we cash these distinctions out in terms of different kinds of generative models, and the representational and uncertainty-resolving capacities they afford. This analysis leads us to propose a formal criterion for delineating cognition from other, more pervasive forms of adaptive plasticity. On this view, biological cognition is rooted in a particular kind of functional organisation; namely, that which enables the agent to detach from the present and engage in counterfactual (active) inference.},

              Backgrounds
              Value-based decision-making impairment in depression is a complex phenomenon: while some studies did find evidence of blunted reward learning and reward-related signals in the brain, others indicate no effect. Here we test whether such reward sensitivity deficits are dependent on the overall value of the decision problem.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We used a two-armed bandit task with two different contexts: one ‘rich’, one ‘poor’ where both options were associated with an overall positive, negative expected value, respectively. We tested patients (
                N
                = 30) undergoing a major depressive episode and age, gender and socio-economically matched controls (
                N
                = 26). Learning performance followed by a transfer phase, without feedback, were analyzed to distangle between a decision or a value-update process mechanism. Finally, we used computational model simulation and fitting to link behavioral patterns to learning biases.
              
            
            
              Results
              Control subjects showed similar learning performance in the ‘rich’ and the ‘poor’ contexts, while patients displayed reduced learning in the ‘poor’ context. Analysis of the transfer phase showed that the context-dependent impairment in patients generalized, suggesting that the effect of depression has to be traced to the outcome encoding. Computational model-based results showed that patients displayed a higher learning rate for negative compared to positive outcomes (the opposite was true in controls).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results illustrate that reinforcement learning performances in depression depend on the value of the context. We show that depressive patients have a specific trouble in contexts with an overall negative state value, which in our task is consistent with a negativity bias at the learning rates level.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Major depressive disorder is prevalent and impairing. Parsing neurocomputational substrates of reinforcement learning in individuals with depression may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the disorder and suggest new cognitive therapeutic targets.
OBJECTIVE: To determine associations among computational model-derived reinforcement learning parameters, depression symptoms, and symptom changes after treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this mixed cross-sectional-cohort study, individuals performed reward and loss variants of a probabilistic learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and follow-up. A volunteer sample with and without a depression diagnosis was recruited from the community. Participants were assessed from July 2011 to February 2017, and data were analyzed from May 2017 to May 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Computational model-based analyses of participants' choices assessed a priori hypotheses about associations between components of reward-based and loss-based learning with depression symptoms. Changes in both learning parameters and symptoms were then assessed in a subset of participants who received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
RESULTS: Of 101 included adults, 69 (68.3\%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 34.4 (11.2) years. A total of 69 participants with a depression diagnosis and 32 participants without a depression diagnosis were included at baseline; 48 participants (28 with depression who received CBT and 20 without depression) were included at follow-up (mean [SD] of 115.1 [15.6] days). Computational model-based analyses of behavioral choices and neural data identified associations of learning with symptoms during reward learning and loss learning, respectively. During reward learning only, anhedonia (and not negative affect or arousal) was associated with model-derived learning parameters (learning rate: posterior mean regression β = -0.14; 95\% credible interval [CrI], -0.12 to -0.03; outcome sensitivity: posterior mean regression β = 0.18; 95\% CrI, 0.02 to 0.37) and neural learning signals (moderation of association between striatal prediction error and expected value signals: t97 = -2.10; P = .04). During loss learning only, negative affect (and not anhedonia or arousal) was associated with learning parameters (outcome shift: posterior mean regression β = -0.11; 95\% CrI, -0.20 to -0.01) and disrupted neural encoding of learning signals (association with subgenual anterior cingulate prediction error signals: r = -0.28; P = .005). Symptom improvement following CBT was associated with normalization of learning parameters that were disrupted at baseline (reward learning rate: posterior mean regression β = 0.15; 90\% CrI, 0.001 to 0.41; loss outcome shift: posterior mean regression β = 0.42; 90\% CrI, 0.09 to 0.77).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the mapping of reinforcement learning components to symptoms of major depression revealed mechanistic features associated with these symptoms and points to possible learning-based therapeutic processes and targets.},

Recent research has employed computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) to address these deficits. The computational approach has the advantage in making explicit predictions about learning and behavior, specifying the process parameters of RL, differentiating between model-free and model-based RL, and the computational model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. With these merits there has been an emerging field of computational psychiatry and here we review specific studies that focused on MDD. Considerable evidence suggests that MDD is associated with impaired brain signals of reward prediction error and expected value ('wanting'), decreased reward sensitivity ('liking') and/or learning (be it model-free or model-based), etc., although the causality remains unclear. These parameters may serve as valuable intermediate phenotypes of MDD, linking general clinical symptoms to underlying molecular dysfunctions. We believe future computational research at clinical, systems, and cellular/molecular/genetic levels will propel us toward a better understanding of the disease.},

Our account is simple: anxiety can be formalized as learned uncertainty. A biological system, having had persistent uncertainty in its past, will expect uncertainty in its future, irrespective of whether uncertainty truly persists. Despite our account’s intuitive simplicity—which can be illustrated with the mere flip of a coin—it is grounded within the free energy principle and hence situates the formation of anxiety within a broader explanatory framework of biological self-organization and self-evidencing. We conclude that, through conceptualizing anxiety within a framework of working generative models, our perspective might afford novel approaches in the clinical treatment of anxiety and its key symptoms.},

	abstract = {In the Algorithmic Information Theory of Consciousness (KT), algorithmic agents use compressive models inferred from world data to plan actions that maximize their objective function. What are the structural and dynamical consequences of tracking natural data generated by simple world models? To address this, we first propose a formalization of the concept of a generative model using the language of symmetry—Lie group theory. Then, using a generic neural network model as an agent system, we show that data tracking constrains the agent’s dynamical repertoire, forcing it to mirror the symmetry of the generative world model. This narrows down both the space of potential parameters of the agent system and its dynamical repertoire, endowing both with structure inherited from the world. Based on these insights, we examine the link between data-tracking and the manifold hypothesis, which posits that natural high-dimensional data can be compressed into a reduced number of parameters due to the presence of a low-dimensional invariant manifold within the high-dimensional phase space. This work offers a new perspective for identifying neural correlates of agenthood and structured experience in natural agents and for developing AI and computational brain models.
HighlightsWe define generative models using Lie groups.We associate the algorithmic simplicity of a model with representations of Lie groups or Lie algebras with special properties such as nilpotency and compositionality (hierarchical function composition).We show that world-tracking constraints force the tracking dynamical system to mirror the symmetry in the data.In this context, we revisit the manifold hypothesis and the implications for AI design and brain modeling.},

This allows us to examine general dynamical properties of metastable regimes, propose in a didactic manner several dynamics-based mechanisms that generate them, and discuss a theoretical tool to characterize them quantitatively.

Seventy-three per cent of the examined systematic reviews were of high quality.Our findings revealed that mechanisms underlying placebo and/or nocebo effects have been characterised, at least in part, for: pain, non-noxious somatic sensation, Parkinson's disease, migraine, sleep disorders, intellectual disability, depression, anxiety, dementia, addiction, gynaecological disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, immune and endocrine systems, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, gastrointestinal disorders, skin diseases, influenza and related vaccines, oncology, obesity, physical and cognitive performance. Their magnitude ranged from 0.08 to 2.01 (95\% CI 0.37 to 0.89) for placebo effects and from 0.32 to 0.90 (95\% CI 0.24 to 1.00) for nocebo effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers, identifying both results ready for clinical practice and gaps to address in the near future.

	abstract = {Neither psychological nor neuroscientific investigations have been able to fully explain the paradox that placebo is designed to be inert in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet appears to be effective in evaluations of clinical interventions in all fields of medicine and alternative medicine. This article develops the Neuroplasticity Placebo Theory, which posits that neuroplasticity in fronto-limbic areas is the unifying factor in placebo response (seen in RCTs) and placebo effect (seen in clinical interventions) where it is not intended to be inert. Depression is the disorder that has the highest placebo response of any medical condition and has the greatest potential for understanding how placebos work: recent developments in understanding of the pathophysiology of depression suggest that fronto-limbic areas are sensitized in depression which is associated with a particularly strong placebo phenomenon. An innovative linkage is made between diverse areas of the psychology and the translational psychiatry literature to provide supportive evidence for the Neuroplasticity Placebo Theory. This is underpinned by neuro-radiological evidence of fronto-limbic change in the placebo arm of antidepressant trials. If placebo stimulates neuroplasticity in fronto-limbic areas in conditions other than depression - and results in a partially active treatment in other areas of medicine - there are far reaching consequences for the day-to-day use of placebo in clinical practice, the future design of RCTs in all clinical conditions, and existing unwarranted assertions about the efficacy of antidepressant medications. If fronto-limbic neuroplasticity is the common denominator in designating placebo as a partially active treatment, the terms placebo effect and placebo response should be replaced by the single term "placebo treatment."},

It is now clear that the term placebo effect is too restrictive and, in fact, many placebo-related effects have recently been investigated. A placebo effect differs from a placebo-like effect in that the former follows the administration of a placebo, whereas in the latter no placebo is administered. However, in both cases, the psychosocial context around the treatment plays a key role. In recent years, placebo and placebo-related effects have been analyzed with sophisticated biological tools that have uncovered specific mechanisms at both the biochemical and cellular level. This recent research has revealed that these psychosocial-induced biochemical changes in a patient's brain and body in turn may affect the course of a disease and the response to a therapy.},

Specifically, we propose that the alignment or 'coherence' between affective arousal (e.g. how excited we 'feel') and autonomic arousal (e.g. heart rate or pupil dilation) may be key for maintaining up-to-date uncertainty representations in dynamic environments. Drawing on recent advances in interoceptive and affective inference, we also propose that arousal coherence reflects interoceptive integration, facilitates adaptive belief updating, and impacts our capacity to adapt to changes in uncertainty, with downstream consequences to well-being. We also highlight the role of meta-awareness of arousal, a third level of inference, which may permit conscious awareness, learning about, and intentional regulation of lower-order sources of arousal. Practices emphasizing meta-awareness of arousal (like meditation) may therefore elicit some of their known benefits via improved arousal coherence. We suggest that arousal coherence is also likely to be associated with markers of adaptive functioning (like emotional awareness and self-regulatory capacities) and discuss mind-body practices that may increase coherence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression in pregnancy negatively affects maternal-child health. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment for depression, has not been evaluated in pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate tDCS for antenatal depression.
METHODS: In this pilot RCT in Toronto, Ontario (October 2014 to December 2016), adult pregnant women 14-32 weeks gestation with major depressive disorder who had declined antidepressant medication were considered for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to tDCS or sham-control. Active tDCS comprised 30-min sessions of 2 mAmp direct current delivered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks. Sham was administered similarly, but with current turned off after 30 s. Main outcomes were feasibility, acceptability, and protocol adherence. Maternal Montgomery Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was measured post-treatment and at 4 and 12 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: Of 20 women randomized, 16 completed treatment and provided data (124 tDCS, 122 sham sessions). Views of treatment were positive with no serious adverse events. Post-treatment estimated marginal mean MADRS scores were 11.8 (standard error, SE 2.66) for tDCS and 15.4 (SE 2.51) for sham (p = 0.34). At 4 weeks postpartum, 75.0\% of tDCS women were remitted versus 12.5\% sham-control (p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Results support proceeding to a definitive RCT to evaluate tDCS for antenatal depression. The preliminary efficacy estimates immediately post-treatment and in the postpartum, are encouraging with respect to the potential use of tDCS to improve treatment rates in this population. The trial was registered at: clinical trials.gov (NCT02116127).},

Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is an effective and safe treatment for many psychiatric disorders. Given the reluctance to use pharmacological treatments during pregnancy or breastfeeding, tES may be an interesting treatment to consider. Our study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tES in the perinatal period through a systematic literature review followed by three original case reports. Method: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of MEDLINE and ScienceDirect was undertaken to identify studies on tES on women during the perinatal period. The initial research was conducted until 31 December 2021 and search terms included: tDCS, transcranial direct current stimulation, tACS, transcranial alternating current stimulation, tRNS, transcranial random noise stimulation, pregnancy, perinatal, postnatal, and postpartum. Results: Seven studies reporting on 33 women during the perinatal period met the eligibility criteria. No serious adverse effects for the mother or child were reported. Data were limited to the use of tES during pregnancy in patients with schizophrenia or unipolar depression. In addition, we reported three original case reports illustrating the efficacy and safety of tDCS: in a pregnant woman with bipolar depression, in a pregnant woman with post-traumatic stress disorder (sham tDCS), and in a breastfeeding woman with postpartum depression. Conclusions: The results are encouraging, making tES a potentially safe and effective treatment in the perinatal period. Larger studies are needed to confirm these initial results, and any adverse effects on the mother or child should be reported. In addition, research perspectives on the medico-economic benefits of tES, and its realization at home, are to be investigated in the future.},

It is known that interbrain activity coupling, i.e., the synchronization of neural activity between individuals, represents the neural basis of social interactions. Here, previously unknown cross-species interbrain activity coupling in interacting human–dog dyads is reported. By analyzing electroencephalography signals from both dogs and humans, it is found that mutual gaze and petting induce interbrain synchronization in the frontal and parietal regions of the human–dog dyads, respectively. The strength of the synchronization increases with growing familiarity of the human–dog dyad over five days, and the information flow analysis suggests that the human is the leader while the dog is the follower during human–dog interactions. Furthermore, dogs with Shank3 mutations, which represent a promising complementary animal model of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), show a loss of interbrain coupling and reduced attention during human–dog interactions. Such abnormalities are rescued by the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The results reveal previously unknown interbrain synchronizations within an interacting human–dog dyad which may underlie the interspecies communication, and suggest a potential of LSD for the amelioration of social impairment in patients with ASD.},

	abstract = {Instructing the model to generate a sequence of intermediate steps, a.k.a., a chain of thought (CoT), is a highly effective method to improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on arithmetics and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, the mechanism behind CoT remains unclear. This work provides a theoretical understanding of the power of CoT for decoder-only transformers through the lens of expressiveness. Conceptually, CoT empowers the model with the ability to perform inherently serial computation, which is otherwise lacking in transformers, especially when depth is low. Given input length \$n\$, previous works have shown that constant-depth transformers with finite precision \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{poly\}(n)\$ embedding size can only solve problems in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{TC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$ without CoT. We first show an even tighter expressiveness upper bound for constant-depth transformers with constant-bit precision, which can only solve problems in \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{AC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$, a proper subset of \$ {\textbackslash}mathsf\{TC\}{\textasciicircum}0\$. However, with \$T\$ steps of CoT, constant-depth transformers using constant-bit precision and \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ embedding size can solve any problem solvable by boolean circuits of size \$T\$. Empirically, enabling CoT dramatically improves the accuracy for tasks that are hard for parallel computation, including the composition of permutation groups, iterated squaring, and circuit value problems, especially for low-depth transformers.},

They encode prior information about the modeled function and can be used for exact or approximate Bayesian learning.

The invariance of a Gaussian process' covariance to such symmetries gives rise to the most natural generalization of the concept of stationarity to such spaces. In this work, we develop constructive and practical techniques for building stationary Gaussian processes on a very large class of non-Euclidean spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our techniques make it possible to (i) calculate covariance kernels and (ii) sample from prior and posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces, both in a practical manner. This work is split into two parts, each involving different technical considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while part II studies non-compact spaces possessing certain structure. Our contributions make the non-Euclidean Gaussian process models we study compatible with well-understood computational techniques available in standard Gaussian process software packages, thereby making them accessible to practitioners.},

Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), yet the complex mechanisms underlying ketamine's anti-suicidal effect are not fully understood. Computational psychiatry provides a promising framework for exploring the dynamic interactions underlying suicidality and ketamine's therapeutic action, offering insight into potential biomarkers, treatment targets, and the underlying mechanisms of both. This paper provides an overview of current computational theories of suicidality and ketamine's mechanism of action, and discusses various computational modeling approaches that attempt to explain ketamine's anti-suicidal effect. More specifically, the therapeutic potential of ketamine is explored in the context of the mismatch negativity and the predictive coding framework, by considering neurocircuits involved in learning and decision-making, and investigating altered connectivity strengths and receptor densities targeted by ketamine. Theory-driven computational models offer a promising approach to integrate existing knowledge of suicidality and ketamine, and for the extraction of model-derived mechanistic parameters that can be used to identify patient subgroups and personalized treatment approaches. Future computational studies on ketamine's mechanism of action should optimize task design and modeling approaches to ensure parameter reliability, and external factors such as set and setting, as well as psychedelic-assisted therapy should be evaluated for their additional therapeutic value.},

	abstract = {Psychiatry faces fundamental challenges: based on a syndrome-based nosology, it presently lacks clinical tests to infer on disease processes that cause symptoms of individual patients and must resort to trial-and-error treatment strategies. These challenges have fueled the recent emergence of a novel field-computational psychiatry-that strives for mathematical models of disease processes at physiological and computational (information processing) levels. This review is motivated by one particular goal of computational psychiatry: the development of 'computational assays' that can be applied to behavioral or neuroimaging data from individual patients and support differential diagnosis and guiding patient-specific treatment. Because the majority of available pharmacotherapeutic approaches in psychiatry target neuromodulatory transmitters, models that infer (patho)physiological and (patho)computational actions of different neuromodulatory transmitters are of central interest for computational psychiatry. This article reviews the (many) outstanding questions on the computational roles of neuromodulators (dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline), outlines available evidence, and discusses promises and pitfalls in translating these findings to clinical applications.

If successful, this approach promises key insights into (pathological) brain function as well as a more mechanistic and quantitative approach to psychiatric nosology—structuring therapeutic interventions and predicting response and relapse. The basic procedure in computational psychiatry is to build a computational model that formalizes a behavioral or neuronal process. Measured behavioral (or neuronal) responses are then used to infer the model parameters of a single subject or a group of subjects. Here, we provide an illustrative overview over this process, starting from the modeling of choice behavior in a specific task, simulating data, and then inverting that model to estimate group effects. Finally, we illustrate cross-validation to assess whether between-subject variables (e.g., diagnosis) can be recovered successfully. Our worked example uses a simple two-step maze task and a model of choice behavior based on (active) inference and Markov decision processes. The procedural steps and routines we illustrate are not restricted to a specific field of research or particular computational model but can, in principle, be applied in many domains of computational psychiatry.},

In so doing, it may improve psychiatric classification and the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. It can unite many levels of description in a mechanistic and rigorous fashion, while avoiding biological reductionism and artificial categorisation. We describe how computational models of cognition can infer the current state of the environment and weigh up future actions, and how these models provide new perspectives on two example disorders, depression and schizophrenia. Reinforcement learning describes how the brain can choose and value courses of actions according to their long-term future value. Some depressive symptoms may result from aberrant valuations, which could arise from prior beliefs about the loss of agency ('helplessness'), or from an inability to inhibit the mental exploration of aversive events. Predictive coding explains how the brain might perform Bayesian inference about the state of its environment by combining sensory data with prior beliefs, each weighted according to their certainty (or precision). Several cortical abnormalities in schizophrenia might reduce precision at higher levels of the inferential hierarchy, biasing inference towards sensory data and away from prior beliefs. We discuss whether striatal hyperdopaminergia might have an adaptive function in this context, and also how reinforcement learning and incentive salience models may shed light on the disorder. Finally, we review some of Computational Psychiatry's applications to neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, and some pitfalls to avoid when applying its methods.},

We then summarise current research at one of the most exciting frontiers of computational psychiatry: reinforcement learning models of mood disorders.

We start by considering the behavioral implications of pessimistic evaluations of decision variables. We then provide a selective review of work suggesting how such pessimism might arise via specific failures of the mechanisms of evaluation or state estimation. Finally, we analyze ways that miscalibration between the subject and environment may be self-perpetuating. We employ the formal framework of Bayesian decision theory as a foundation for this study, showing how most of the problems arise from one of its broad algorithmic facets, namely model-based reasoning.},

	abstract = {Large transformers are powerful architectures used for self-supervised data analysis across various data types, including protein sequences, images, and text. In these models, the semantic structure of the dataset emerges from a sequence of transformations between one representation and the next. We characterize the geometric and statistical properties of these representations and how they change as we move through the layers. By analyzing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and neighbor composition, we find that the representations evolve similarly in transformers trained on protein language tasks and image reconstruction tasks. In the first layers, the data manifold expands, becoming high-dimensional, and then contracts significantly in the intermediate layers. In the last part of the model, the ID remains approximately constant or forms a second shallow peak. We show that the semantic information of the dataset is better expressed at the end of the first peak, and this phenomenon can be observed across many models trained on diverse datasets. Based on our findings, we point out an explicit strategy to identify, without supervision, the layers that maximize semantic content: representations at intermediate layers corresponding to a relative minimum of the ID profile are more suitable for downstream learning tasks.},

	abstract = {Temporal neural synchrony disruption can be linked to a variety of symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), including mood rigidity and the inability to break the cycle of negative emotion or attention biases. This might imply that altered dynamic neural synchrony may play a role in the persistence and exacerbation of MDD symptoms. Our study aimed to investigate the changes in whole-brain dynamic patterns of the brain functional connectivity and activity related to depression using the hidden Markov model (HMM) on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. We compared the patterns of brain functional dynamics in a large sample of 314 patients with MDD (65.9\% female; age (mean ± standard deviation): 35.9 ± 13.4) and 498 healthy controls (59.4\% female; age: 34.0 ± 12.8). The HMM model was used to explain variations in rs-fMRI functional connectivity and averaged functional activity across the whole-brain by using a set of six unique recurring states. This study compared the proportion of time spent in each state and the average duration of visits to each state to assess stability between different groups. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD showed significantly higher proportional time spent and temporal stability in a state characterized by weak functional connectivity within and between all brain networks and relatively strong averaged functional activity of regions located in the somatosensory motor (SMN), salience (SN), and dorsal attention (DAN) networks. Both proportional time spent and temporal stability of this brain state was significantly associated with depression severity. Healthy controls, in contrast to the MDD group, showed proportional time spent and temporal stability in a state with relatively strong functional connectivity within and between all brain networks but weak averaged functional activity across the whole brain. These findings suggest that disrupted brain functional synchrony across time is present in MDD and associated with current depression severity.},

	abstract = {Decades of neuroimaging studies have shown modest differences in brain structure and connectivity in depression, hindering mechanistic insights or the identification of risk factors for disease onset1. Furthermore, whereas depression is episodic, few longitudinal neuroimaging studies exist, limiting understanding of mechanisms that drive mood-state transitions. The emerging field of precision functional mapping has used densely sampled longitudinal neuroimaging data to show behaviourally meaningful differences in brain network topography and connectivity between and in healthy individuals2–4, but this approach has not been applied in depression. Here, using precision functional mapping and several samples of deeply sampled individuals, we found that the frontostriatal salience network is expanded nearly twofold in the cortex of most individuals with depression. This effect was replicable in several samples and caused primarily by network border shifts, with three distinct modes of encroachment occurring in different individuals. Salience network expansion was stable over time, unaffected by mood state and detectable in children before the onset of depression later in adolescence. Longitudinal analyses of individuals scanned up to 62 times over 1.5 years identified connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that tracked fluctuations in specific symptoms and predicted future anhedonia symptoms. Together, these findings identify a trait-like brain network topology that may confer risk for depression and mood-state-dependent connectivity changes in frontostriatal circuits that predict the emergence and remission of depressive symptoms over time.},

	abstract = {Recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) reveal that the sensory cortex displays rhythmic activity and fluctuations over a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory–excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus–neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment., The brain displays rhythmic activity in almost all areas and over a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. However, the role of these rhythms in the processing of sensory information is still unclear. To study the interplay between visual stimuli and ongoing oscillations in the brain, we developed a model of a local circuit of the visual cortex. We injected into the network the signal recorded in the thalamus of an anesthetized monkey watching a movie, to mimic the effect of a naturalistic stimulus arriving at the visual cortex. Our results are in striking agreement with recordings from the visual cortex. Furthermore, through manipulations of the signal and information analysis, we found that two specific frequency bands of the neurons' activity are used to encode independent stimuli features. These results describe how sensory stimuli can modulate frequency and amplitude of ongoing neural activity and how these modulations can be used to convey sensory information through the different layers of the brain.},

In this review, we first describe an introductory-level thought experiment to provide the reader with an intuitive understanding of criticality. Second, we discuss some practical approaches for investigating criticality. Finally, we review quantitative evidence that three functional properties of the cortex are optimized at criticality: 1) dynamic range, 2) information transmission, and 3) information capacity.

	abstract = {Networks of living neurons exhibit diverse patterns of activity, including oscillations, synchrony, and waves. Recent work in physics has shown yet another mode of activity in systems composed of many nonlinear units interacting locally. For example, avalanches, earthquakes, and forest fires all propagate in systems organized into a critical state in which event sizes show no characteristic scale and are described by power laws. We hypothesized that a similar mode of activity with complex emergent properties could exist in networks of cortical neurons. We investigated this issue in mature organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat cortex by recording spontaneous local field potentials continuously using a 60 channel multielectrode array. Here, we show that propagation of spontaneous activity in cortical networks is described by equations that govern avalanches. As predicted by theory for a critical branching process, the propagation obeys a power law with an exponent of -3/2 for event sizes, with a branching parameter close to the critical value of 1. Simulations show that a branching parameter at this value optimizes information transmission in feedforward networks, while preventing runaway network excitation. Our findings suggest that "neuronal avalanches" may be a generic property of cortical networks, and represent a mode of activity that differs profoundly from oscillatory, synchronized, or wave-like network states. In the critical state, the network may satisfy the competing demands of information transmission and network stability.},

Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure–function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

Specifically, (i) counterfactual theories do not effectively capture multiple independently sufficient causes of the same effect, which leads us to miss certain causes entirely; and (ii) counterfactual dependencies in neural networks are generally not transitive, which complicates methods for extracting and interpreting causal graphs from neural networks. We discuss the implications of these challenges for interpretability researchers and propose concrete suggestions for future work.},

Prestimulus activity originating from distributed brain regions, including visual cortices and regions of the default-mode and cingulo-opercular networks, exerted a diverse set of effects on the sensitivity and criterion of conscious recognition, and categorization performance. We further elucidate the mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects, revealing how prestimulus activity modulates multiple aspects of stimulus processing in highly specific and network-dependent manners. These findings reveal heretofore unknown network mechanisms underlying ongoing brain activity’s influence on conscious perception, and may hold implications for understanding the precise roles of spontaneous activity in other brain functions.},

	abstract = {Noise driven exploration of a brain network’s dynamic repertoire has been hypothesized to be causally involved in cognitive function, aging and neurodegeneration. The dynamic repertoire crucially depends on the network’s capacity to store patterns, as well as their stability. Here we systematically explore the capacity of networks derived from human connectomes to store attractor states, as well as various network mechanisms to control the brain’s dynamic repertoire. Using a deterministic graded response Hopfield model with connectome-based interactions, we reconstruct the system’s attractor space through a uniform sampling of the initial conditions. Large fixed-point attractor sets are obtained in the low temperature condition, with a bigger number of attractors than ever reported so far. Different variants of the initial model, including (i) a uniform activation threshold or (ii) a global negative feedback, produce a similarly robust multistability in a limited parameter range. A numerical analysis of the distribution of the attractors identifies spatially-segregated components, with a centro-medial core and several well-delineated regional patches. Those different modes share similarity with the fMRI independent components observed in the “resting state” condition. We demonstrate non-stationary behavior in noise-driven generalizations of the models, with different meta-stable attractors visited along the same time course. Only the model with a global dynamic density control is found to display robust and long-lasting non-stationarity with no tendency toward either overactivity or extinction. The best fit with empirical signals is observed at the edge of multistability, a parameter region that also corresponds to the highest entropy of the attractors.},

At present, even the most advanced artificial intelligence-based systems are unable to replicate the multisensory processes that the human brain routinely performs, but how neural circuits in the brain carry out these processes is still not well understood. In this Perspective, we discuss recent findings that shed fresh light on the oscillatory neural mechanisms that mediate multisensory integration (MI), including power modulations, phase resetting, phase–amplitude coupling and dynamic functional connectivity. We then consider studies that also suggest multi-timescale dynamics in intrinsic ongoing neural activity and during stimulus-driven bottom–up and cognitive top–down neural network processing in the context of MI. We propose a new concept of MI that emphasizes the critical role of neural dynamics at multiple timescales within and across brain networks, enabling the simultaneous integration, segregation, hierarchical structuring and selection of information in different time windows. To highlight predictions from our multi-timescale concept of MI, real-world scenarios in which multi-timescale processes may coordinate MI in a flexible and adaptive manner are considered.},

Understanding the psychological and neurobiological processes producing religious fundamentalism may inform a variety of scientific, sociological, and cultural questions. Research indicates that brain damage can alter religious fundamentalism. However, the precise brain regions involved with these changes remain unknown. Here, we analyzed brain lesions associated with varying levels of religious fundamentalism in two large datasets from independent laboratories. Lesions associated with greater fundamentalism were connected to a specific brain network with nodes in the right orbitofrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal lobes. This fundamentalism network was strongly right hemisphere lateralized and highly reproducible across the independent datasets (r = 0.82) with cross-validations between datasets. To explore the relationship of this network to lesions previously studied by our group, we tested for similarities to twenty-one lesion-induced conditions. Lesions associated with confabulation and criminal behavior showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with greater fundamentalism. Moreover, lesions associated with poststroke pain showed a similar connectivity pattern as lesions associated with lower fundamentalism. These findings are consistent with hemispheric specializations in reasoning and lend insight into previously observed epidemiological associations with fundamentalism, such as cognitive rigidity and outgroup hostility.},

	abstract = {Psychedelics exert unique effects on human consciousness. The thalamic filter model suggests that core effects of psychedelics may result from gating deficits, based on a disintegration of information processing within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) feedback loops. To test this hypothesis, we characterized changes in directed (effective) connectivity between selected CTSC regions after acute administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and after pretreatment with Ketanserin (a selective serotonin 2A receptor antagonist) plus LSD in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 25 healthy participants. We used spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for resting-state fMRI data. Fully connected DCM models were specified for each treatment condition to investigate the connectivity between the following areas: thalamus, ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal cortex. Our results confirm major predictions proposed in the CSTC model and provide evidence that LSD alters effective connectivity within CSTC pathways that have been implicated in the gating of sensory and sensorimotor information to the cortex. In particular, LSD increased effective connectivity from the thalamus to the posterior cingulate cortex in a way that depended on serotonin 2A receptor activation, and decreased effective connectivity from the ventral striatum to the thalamus independently of serotonin 2A receptor activation. Together, these results advance our mechanistic understanding of the action of psychedelics in health and disease. This is important for the development of new pharmacological therapeutics and also increases our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the potential clinical efficacy of psychedelics.},

Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.},

In this study, we aim to advance mobile electroencephalography (EEG) participant and device mobility. We investigated the feasibility of measuring human brain activity using mobile EEG during a full-body motion task as swimming, by the example of cognitive-motor interference (CMI). Eleven participants were given an auditory oddball task while sitting and swimming, with mobile EEG recording ongoing brain activity. Measures of interest were event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by experimental stimuli. While the auditory N100 was measured to verify signal quality, the P300 to task-relevant stimuli served as a marker of CMI effects. Analyzes were first performed within subjects, while binomial tests assessed the proportion of significant effects. Event-related changes in the time-frequency domain around turns during swimming were analyzed in an exploratory fashion. The successful recording of the N100 in all conditions shows that the setup was functional throughout the experiment. Regarding CMI, we did not find reliable changes in P300 amplitude in different motor settings in all subjects. However, we found plausible modulations in the alpha/mu and beta bands before and after turns. This study shows that it is generally feasible to measure mobile EEG in the time and time-frequency domain in an aquatic environment while subjects are freely moving. We see promising potential in the use of mobile EEG in extreme settings, advancing toward the application of mobile EEG in more real-life situations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1–10. Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits.},

A new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, has challenged the notion that glia outnumber neurons and revived a question that was widely thought to have been resolved. The recently validated isotropic fractionator demonstrates a glia:neuron ratio of less than 1:1 and a total number of less than 100 billion glial cells in the human brain. A survey of original evidence shows that histological data always supported a 1:1 ratio of glia to neurons in the entire human brain, and a range of 40–130 billion glial cells. We review how the claim of one trillion glial cells originated, was perpetuated, and eventually refuted. We compile how numbers of neurons and glial cells in the adult human brain were reported and we examine the reasons for an erroneous consensus about the relative abundance of glial cells in human brains that persisted for half a century. Our review includes a brief history of cell counting in human brains, types of counting methods that were and are employed, ranges of previous estimates, and the current status of knowledge about the number of cells. We also discuss implications and consequences of the new insights into true numbers of glial cells in the human brain, and the promise and potential impact of the newly validated isotropic fractionator for reliable quantification of glia and neurons in neurological and psychiatric diseases.},

These facts led to the widespread notion that the human brain is literally extraordinary: an outlier among mammalian brains, defying evolutionary rules that apply to other species, with a uniqueness seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over mammals with even larger brains. These facts, with deep implications for neurophysiology and evolutionary biology, are not grounded on solid evidence or sound assumptions, however. Our recent development of a method that allows rapid and reliable quantification of the numbers of cells that compose the whole brain has provided a means to verify these facts. Here, I review this recent evidence and argue that, with 86 billion neurons and just as many nonneuronal cells, the human brain is a scaled-up primate brain in its cellular composition and metabolic cost, with a relatively enlarged cerebral cortex that does not have a relatively larger number of brain neurons yet is remarkable in its cognitive abilities and metabolism simply because of its extremely large number of neurons.},

The hypothesis that resting state activity reflects internal body states was validated by the interoceptive circuit's capability to enhance the similarity between the simulation model and the biological brain. We identified that the removal of connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) to downstream visual pathways significantly decreased the similarity at the hippocampus between the model and its biological counterpart, despite a slight influence on the whole brain.

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background:
Ictal stereo-encephalography (sEEG) biomarkers for seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization can be classified depending on whether they target abnormalities in signal power or functional connectivity between signals, and they may depend on the frequency band and time window at which they are estimated.
New method:
This work aimed to compare and optimize the performance of a power and a connectivity-based biomarker to identify SOZ contacts from ictal sEEG recordings. To do so, we used a previously introduced power-based measure, the normalized mean activation (nMA), which quantifies the ictal average power activation. Similarly, we defined the normalized mean strength (nMS), to quantify the ictal mean functional connectivity of every contact with the rest. The optimal frequency bands and time windows were selected based on optimizing AUC and F2-score.
Results:
The analysis was performed on a dataset of 67 seizures from 10 patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Our results suggest that the power-based biomarker generally performs better for the detection of SOZ than the connectivity-based one. However, an equivalent performance level can be achieved when both biomarkers are independently optimized. Optimal performance was achieved in the beta and lower-gamma range for the power biomarker and in the lower- and higher-gamma range for connectivity, both using a 20 or 30 s period after seizure onset.
Conclusions:
The results of this study highlight the importance of this optimization step over frequency and time windows when comparing different SOZ discrimination biomarkers. This information should be considered when training SOZ classifiers on retrospective patients’ data for clinical applications.},

Recent research suggests that psychedelic drugs, known for their complexity-enhancing properties, could be promising treatments for DoC. This study uses whole-brain computational models to explore this potential. We created individualised models for DoC patients, optimised with empirical fMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data, and simulated the administration of LSD and psilocybin. We used an in-silico perturbation protocol to distinguish between different states of consciousness, including DoC, anaesthesia, and the psychedelic state, and assess the dynamical stability of the brains of DoC patients pre- and post-psychedelic simulation. Our findings indicate that LSD and psilocybin shift DoC patients’ brains closer to criticality, with a greater effect in MCS patients. In UWS patients, the treatment response correlates with structural connectivity, while in MCS patients, it aligns with baseline functional connectivity. This virtual clinical trial lays a computational foundation for using psychedelics in DoC treatment and highlights the future role of computational modelling in drug discovery and personalised medicine.},

On top of revealing complex neuronal processes of the brain that may not be possible with linear approaches, EEG complexity measures have also demonstrated their potential as biomarkers of psychopathology such as depression and schizophrenia. Unfortunately, the opacity of algorithms and descriptions originating from mathematical concepts have made it difficult to understand what complexity is and how to draw consistent conclusions when applied within psychology and neuropsychiatry research. In this review, we provide an overview and entry‐level explanation of existing EEG complexity measures, which can be broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity. We then synthesize complexity findings across different areas of psychological science, namely, in consciousness research, mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as changes across the lifespan, while addressing some theoretical and methodological issues underlying the discrepancies in the data. Finally, we present important considerations when choosing and interpreting these metrics., In light of the increasing popularity of complexity analysis in quantifying neural activity measured by electroencephalography (EEG) signals, we provide an overview of existing EEG complexity measures, broadly categorized as measures of predictability and regularity.

Spontaneous and induced oscillatory activity was recorded in healthy human participants with magnetoencephalography after intravenous infusion of psilocybin—prodrug of the nonselective serotonin 2A receptor agonist and classic psychedelic psilocin. Psilocybin reduced spontaneous cortical oscillatory power from 1 to 50 Hz in posterior association cortices, and from 8 to 100 Hz in frontal association cortices. Large decreases in oscillatory power were seen in areas of the default-mode network. Independent component analysis was used to identify a number of resting-state networks, and activity in these was similarly decreased after psilocybin. Psilocybin had no effect on low-level visually induced and motor-induced gamma-band oscillations, suggesting that some basic elements of oscillatory brain activity are relatively preserved during the psychedelic experience. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that posterior cingulate cortex desynchronization can be explained by increased excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which are known to be rich in 5-HT2A receptors. These findings suggest that the subjective effects of psychedelics result from a desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex, likely triggered by 5-HT2A receptor-mediated excitation of deep pyramidal cells.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of which brain properties are required for consciousness is essential for improving clinical diagnostics and therapy as well as for investigating consciousness per se. The search for such properties has yielded many methods and measures for distinguishing conscious and apparently unconscious brain states. Here, we present a systematic literature review of 255 electroencephalography (EEG)-based measures of consciousness in humans. We show that measures based on signal diversity and event related potentials appear to be the most consistent. Specifically, spectral entropy, Lempel Ziv complexity, and spectral edge frequency, seem most practical, consistent, and reproducible. However, since most studies did not collect current or retrospective subjective reports about experiences, the states of consciousness were usually assessed from behavior. Hence, the ground truth about presence or absence of phenomenological experience in such cases is often uncertain, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. We provide detailed overviews of general categories and specific measures of consciousness, to serve as a basis for further studies and future development.},

	abstract = {Psychedelics offer a profound window into the functioning of the human brain and mind through their robust acute effects on perception, subjective experience, and brain activity patterns. In recent work using a receptor-informed network control theory framework, we demonstrated that the serotonergic psychedelics lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin flatten the brain’s control energy landscape in a manner that covaries with more dynamic and entropic brain activity. Contrary to LSD and psilocybin, whose effects last for hours, the serotonergic psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) rapidly induces a profoundly immersive altered state of consciousness lasting less than 20 minutes, allowing for the entirety of the drug experience to be captured during a single resting-state fMRI scan. Using network control theory, which quantifies the amount of input necessary to drive transitions between functional brain states, we integrate brain structure and function to map the energy trajectories of 14 individuals undergoing fMRI during DMT and placebo. Consistent with previous work, we find that global control energy is reduced following injection with DMT compared to placebo. We additionally show longitudinal trajectories of global control energy correlate with longitudinal trajectories of EEG signal diversity (a measure of entropy) and subjective ratings of drug intensity. We interrogate these same relationships on a regional level and find that the spatial patterns of DMT’s effects on these metrics are correlated with serotonin 2a receptor density (obtained from separately acquired PET data). Using receptor distribution and pharmacokinetic information, we were able to successfully recapitulate the effects of DMT on global control energy trajectories, demonstrating a proof-of-concept for the use of control models in predicting pharmacological intervention effects on brain dynamics.},

	abstract = {We propose that the neocortex implements active predictive coding (APC), a form of predictive coding that incorporates hierarchical dynamics and actions. In this model, each neocortical area estimates both sensory states and actions, and the cortex as whole learns to predict the sensory consequences of actions at multiple hierarchical levels. “Higher” cortical areas maintain more abstract representations at larger spatiotemporal scales compared to “lower” areas. Feedback from higher areas modulate the dynamics of both state and action networks in lower areas. This allows the cortical network to model the complex dynamics and physics of the world in terms of simpler compositional elements (state transition functions). Simultaneously, current higher level goals invoke sequences of lower level sub-goals and actions, allowing the network to solve complex planning problems by composing simpler solutions. Planning (“system 2” thinking) in turns allows the network to learn, over time, perception-to-action mappings (policies; “system 1” thinking) at multiple abstraction levels. We provide examples from simulations illustrating how the same APC architecture can solve problems that, at first blush, seem very different from each other: (1) how do we recognize an object and its parts using eye movements? (2) why does perception seem stable despite eye movements? (3) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, and nested reference frames for equivariant vision? (4) how do we model the “physics” of a complex environment by decomposing it into simpler components? (5) how do we plan actions in a complex domain to achieve a goal by composing sequences of sub-goals and simpler actions? and (6) how do we form episodic memories of sensory-motor experiences? We propose a mapping of the APC network to the laminar architecture of the cortex and suggest possible roles for cortico-cortical, cortico-thalamic, cortico-hippocampal and cortico-subcortical pathways.},

This is motivated in the context of neuroscience applications stemming from algorithmic information theory (AIT). Starting with the original 2D Ising model, we show that — together with correlation length of the spin lattice, susceptibility to a uniform external field — the correlation time of the magnetization time series, the compression ratio of the spin lattice, the complexity of the magnetization time series — as derived from Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression—, and the rate of information transmission in the lattice, all reflect the effects of the phase transition, which results in spacetime pockets of uniform magnetization at all scales. We also show that in the Ising model the insertion of sparse long-range couplings has a direct effect on the critical temperature and other parameters. The addition of positive links extends the ordered regime to higher critical temperatures, while negative links have a stronger, disordering influence at the global scale. We discuss some implications for the study of long-range (e.g., ephaptic) interactions in the human brain and the effects of weak perturbations in neural dynamics.},

	volume = {117},
	abstract = {In predictive coding, experience generates predictions that attenuate the feeding forward of predicted stimuli while passing forward unpredicted “errors.” Different models have suggested distinct cortical layers, and rhythms implement predictive coding. We recorded spikes and local field potentials from laminar electrodes in five cortical areas (visual area 4 [V4], lateral intraparietal [LIP], posterior parietal area 7A, frontal eye field [FEF], and prefrontal cortex [PFC]) while monkeys performed a task that modulated visual stimulus predictability. During predictable blocks, there was enhanced alpha (8 to 14 Hz) or beta (15 to 30 Hz) power in all areas during stimulus processing and prestimulus beta (15 to 30 Hz) functional connectivity in deep layers of PFC to the other areas. Unpredictable stimuli were associated with increases in spiking and in gamma-band (40 to 90 Hz) power/connectivity that fed forward up the cortical hierarchy via superficial-layer cortex. Power and spiking modulation by predictability was stimulus specific. Alpha/beta power in LIP, FEF, and PFC inhibited spiking in deep layers of V4. Area 7A uniquely showed increases in high-beta (∼22 to 28 Hz) power/connectivity to unpredictable stimuli. These results motivate a conceptual model, predictive routing. It suggests that predictive coding may be implemented via lower-frequency alpha/beta rhythms that “prepare” pathways processing-predicted inputs by inhibiting feedforward gamma rhythms and associated spiking.},

	abstract = {Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have achieved impressive results on natural language understanding tasks, but they can also generate toxic text such as insults, threats, and profanity, limiting their real-world applications. To overcome this issue, a few text generation approaches aim to detoxify toxic texts using additional LMs or perturbations. However, previous methods require excessive memory, computations, and time which are serious bottlenecks in their real-world application. To address such limitations, we propose an effective yet efficient method for language detoxification using an attribute-discriminative latent space. Specifically, we project the latent space of an original Transformer LM onto a discriminative latent space that well-separates texts by their attributes using a projection block and an attribute discriminator. This allows the LM to control the text generation to be non-toxic with minimal memory and computation overhead. We validate our model, Attribute-Discriminative Language Model (ADLM) on detoxified language and dialogue generation tasks, on which our method significantly outperforms baselines both in performance and efficiency.},

In this letter, we describe a new, unsupervised approach to learning invariances based on Lie group theory. Unlike traditional approaches that sacrifice information about transformations to achieve invariance, the Lie group approach explicitly models the effects of transformations in images. As a result, estimates of transformations are available for other purposes, such as pose estimation and visuomotor control. Previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of images can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, which utilizes a matrix-exponential-based generative model of images and can handle arbitrarily large transformations. We present an unsupervised expectation-maximization algorithm for learning Lie transformation operators directly from image data containing examples of transformations. Our experimental results show that the Lie operators learned by the algorithm from an artificial data set containing six types of affine transformations closely match the analytically predicted affine operators. We then demonstrate that the algorithm can also recover novel transformation operators from natural image sequences. We conclude by showing that the learned operators can be used to both generate and estimate transformations in images, thereby providing a basis for achieving visual invariance.},

	abstract = {A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called \{{\textbackslash}textquotedblleft\}resting state\{{\textbackslash}textquotedblright\} activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson\{{\textbackslash}textendash\}Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at {\textless}0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1\{{\textbackslash}textendash\}2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

Anhedonia is nevertheless considered as a core feature of major depressive disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria for major depression and the definition of melancholic subtype, and regarding its capacity to predict antidepressant response. Behavioral, electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and interview-based measures and self-reports have been used to assess anhedonia, but the most interesting findings concern neuropharmacological and neuroanatomical studies. The analyses of anhedonic non-clinical subjects, nonanhedonic depressed patients, and depressed patients with various levels ofanhedonia seem to favor the hypothesis that the severity of anhedonia is associated with a deficit of activity of the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) and an excess of activity of ventral region of the prefrontal cortex (including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex), with a pivotal, but not exclusive, role of dopamine.},

These early studies identified the amygdala, hippocampus, and other parts of what was termed the 'limbic' system as central parts of the emotional brain. Detailed connectional data on this system began to be obtained in the 1970s and 1980s, as more effective neuroanatomical techniques based on axonal transport became available. In the last 15 years these methods have been applied extensively to the limbic system and prefrontal cortex of monkeys, and much more specific circuits have been defined. In particular, a system has been described that links the medial prefrontal cortex and a few related cortical areas to the amygdala, the ventral striatum and pallidum, the medial thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the periaqueductal gray and other parts of the brainstem. A large body of human data from functional and structural imaging, as well as analysis of lesions and histological material indicates that this system is centrally involved in mood disorders.},

	title = {Neuromodulation for treatment-resistant depression: {Functional} network targets contributing to antidepressive outcomes},
	volume = {17},
	abstract = {Non-invasive brain stimulation is designed to target accessible brain regions that underlie many psychiatric disorders. One such method, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is commonly used in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, for non-responders, the choice of an alternative therapy is unclear and often decided empirically without detailed knowledge of precise circuit dysfunction. This is also true of invasive therapies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), in which responses in TRD patients are linked to circuit activity that varies in each individual. If the functional networks affected by these approaches were better understood, a theoretical basis for selection of interventions could be developed to guide psychiatric treatment pathways. The mechanistic understanding of TMS is that it promotes long-term potentiation of cortical targets, such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which are attenuated in depression. DLPFC is highly interconnected with other networks related to mood and cognition, thus TMS likely alters activity remote from DLPFC, such as in the central executive, salience and default mode networks. When deeper structures such as subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) are targeted using DBS for TRD, response efficacy has depended on proximity to white matter pathways that similarly engage emotion regulation and reward. Many have begun to question whether these networks, targeted by different modalities, overlap or are, in fact, the same. A major goal of current functional and structural imaging in patients with TRD is to elucidate neuromodulatory effects on the aforementioned networks so that treatment of intractable psychiatric conditions may become more predictable and targeted using the optimal technique with fewer iterations. Here, we describe several therapeutic approaches to TRD and review clinical studies of functional imaging and tractography that identify the diverse loci of modulation. We discuss differentiating factors associated with responders and non-responders to these stimulation modalities, with a focus on mechanisms of action for non-invasive and intracranial stimulation modalities. We advance the hypothesis that non-invasive and invasive neuromodulation approaches for TRD are likely impacting shared networks and critical nodes important for alleviating symptoms associated with this disorder. We close by describing a therapeutic framework that leverages personalized connectome-guided target identification for a stepwise neuromodulation paradigm.},

	abstract = {Affective neuroscience aims to understand how affect (pleasure or displeasure) is created by brains. Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for neural representation of pleasure in the brain (gained largely from neuroimaging studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (gained largely from brain manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core pleasure or 'liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes surprisingly localized. Pleasure 'liking' is especially generated by restricted hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread.},

	abstract = {Connections between neurons can be mapped by acquiring and analyzing electron microscopic (EM) brain images. In recent years, this approach has been applied to chunks of brains to reconstruct local connectivity maps that are highly informative, yet inadequate for understanding brain function more globally. Here, we present the first neuronal wiring diagram of a whole adult brain, containing 5x10⁷ chemical synapses between  130,000 neurons reconstructed from a female Drosophila melanogaster. The resource also incorporates annotations of cell classes and types, nerves, hemilineages, and predictions of neurotransmitter identities. Data products are available by download, programmatic access, and interactive browsing and made interoperable with other fly data resources. We show how to derive a projectome, a map of projections between regions, from the connectome. We demonstrate the tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine, and descending neurons), across both hemispheres, and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors all the way to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviors. The technologies and open ecosystem of the FlyWire Consortium set the stage for future large-scale connectome projects in other species.},

	abstract = {Memory systems consolidation is often conceived as the linear, time-dependent, neurobiological shift of memory from hippocampal-cortical to cortico-cortical dependency. We argue that contrary to this unidirectional view of memory reorganization, information about events may be retained in multiple forms (e.g., event-specific sensory-near episodic memory, event-specific gist information, event-general schematic information, or abstract semantic memory). These representations can all form at the time of the event and may continue to coexist for long durations. Their relative strength, composition, and dominance of expression change with time and experience, with task demands, and through their dynamic interaction with one another. These different psychological mnemonic representations depend on distinct functional and structural neurobiological substrates such that there is a neural-psychological representation correspondence (NPRC) among them. We discuss how the dynamics of psychological memory representations are reflected in multiple levels of neurobiological markers and their interactions. By this view, there are only variations of synaptic consolidation and memory dynamics without assuming a distinct systems consolidation process.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Deficits in decoding rewarding (and aversive) signals are present in several neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression and addiction, emphasising the importance of studying the underlying neural circuits in detail. One of the key regions of the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The classical view on the field postulates that NAc dopamine receptor D1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) convey reward signals, while dopamine receptor D2-expressing MSNs (D2-MSNs) encode aversion. Here, we show that both MSN subpopulations can drive reward and aversion, depending on their neuronal stimulation pattern. Brief D1- or D2-MSN optogenetic stimulation elicited positive reinforcement and enhanced cocaine conditioning. Conversely, prolonged activation induced aversion, and in the case of D2-MSNs, decreased cocaine conditioning. Brief stimulation was associated with increased ventral tegmenta area (VTA) dopaminergic tone either directly (for D1-MSNs) or indirectly via ventral pallidum (VP) (for D1- and D2-MSNs). Importantly, prolonged stimulation of either MSN subpopulation induced remarkably distinct electrophysiological effects in these target regions. We further show that blocking κ-opioid receptors in the VTA (but not in VP) abolishes the behavioral effects induced by D1-MSN prolonged stimulation. In turn, blocking δ-opioid receptors in the VP (but not in VTA) blocks the behavioral effects elicited by D2-MSN prolonged stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that D1- and D2-MSNs can bidirectionally control reward and aversion, explaining the existence of controversial studies in the field, and highlights that the proposed striatal functional opposition needs to be reconsidered.},

To study these modifications, the present work compares the topological structure of the deterministic Lorenz (1963) attractor with its stochastically perturbed version. The deterministic attractor is well known to be “strange” but it is frozen in time. When driven by multiplicative noise, the Lorenz model's random attractor (LORA) evolves in time. Algebraic topology sheds light on the most striking effects involved in such an evolution. In order to examine the topological structure of the snapshots that approximate LORA, we use branched manifold analysis through homologies-a technique originally introduced to characterize the topological structure of deterministically chaotic flows-which is being extended herein to nonlinear noise-driven systems. The analysis is performed for a fixed realization of the driving noise at different time instants in time. The results suggest that LORA's evolution includes sharp transitions that appear as topological tipping points.},

	abstract = {It is well established that dopamine transmission is integral in mediating the influence of reward expectations on reward-seeking actions. However, the precise causal role of dopamine transmission in moment-to-moment reward-motivated behavioral control remains contentious, particularly in contexts where it is necessary to refrain from responding to achieve a beneficial outcome. To examine this, we manipulated dopamine transmission pharmacologically as rats performed a Go/No-Go task that required them to either make or withhold action to gain either a small or large reward. D1R Stimulation potentiated cue-driven action initiation, including fast impulsive actions on No-Go trials. By contrast, D1R blockade primarily disrupted the successful completion of Go trial sequences. Surprisingly, while after global D1R blockade this was characterized by a general retardation of reward-seeking actions, nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) D1R blockade had no effect on the speed of action initiation or impulsive actions. Instead, fine-grained analyses showed that this manipulation decreased the precision of animals' goal-directed actions, even though they usually still followed the appropriate response sequence. Strikingly, such “unfocused” responding could also be observed off-drug, particularly when only a small reward was on offer. These findings suggest that the balance of activity at NAcC D1Rs plays a key role in enabling the rapid activation of a focused, reward-seeking state to enable animals to efficiently and accurately achieve their goal.},

	abstract = {Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which noise enhances the response of a system to an input signal. The brain is an example of a system that has to detect and transmit signals in a noisy environment, suggesting that it is a good candidate to take advantage of stochastic resonance. In this work, we aim to identify the optimal levels of noise that promote signal transmission through a simple network model of the human brain. Specifically, using a dynamic model implemented on an anatomical brain network (connectome), we investigate the similarity between an input signal and a signal that has traveled across the network while the system is subject to different noise levels. We find that non-zero levels of noise enhance the similarity between the input signal and the signal that has traveled through the system. The optimal noise level is not unique; rather, there is a set of parameter values at which the information is transmitted with greater precision, this set corresponds to the parameter values that place the system in a critical regime. The multiplicity of critical points in our model allows it to adapt to different noise situations and remain at criticality.},

	abstract = {The development of a persistent depressive affective state has for some time been thought to result from persistent alterations in neurotransmitter-mediated synaptic transmission. While the identity of those transmitters has changed over the years, the literature has lacked mechanistic connections between the neurophysiological mechanisms they regulate, and how these mechanisms alter neuronal function, and, hence, affective homeostasis. This review will examine recent work that suggests that both long-term activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength (“plasticity”), and shifting set points for the ease of induction of future long-term changes (“metaplasticity”), may be critical to establishing and reversing a depressive behavioral state. Activitydependent long-term synaptic plasticity involves both strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections associated with a dizzying array of neurochemical alterations that include synaptic insertion and removal of a number of subtypes of AMPA, NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors, changes in presynaptic glutamate release, and structural changes in dendritic spines. Cellular mechanisms of metaplasticity are far less well understood. Here, we will review the growing evidence that long-term synaptic changes in glutamatergic transmission, in brain regions that regulate mood, are key determinants of affective homeostasis and therapeutic targets with immense potential for drug development.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe regulation of cognitive and emotional processes is critical for proper executive functions and social behavior, but its specific mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we addressed this issue by studying with functional magnetic resonance imaging the changes in network topology that underlie competitive interactions between emotional and cognitive networks in healthy participants. Our behavioral paradigm contrasted periods with high emotional and cognitive demands by including a sadness provocation task followed by a spatial working memory task. The sharp contrast between successive tasks was designed to enhance the separability of emotional and cognitive networks and reveal areas that regulate the flow of information between them (hubs). By applying graph analysis methods on functional connectivity between 20 regions of interest in 22 participants we identified two main brain network modules, one dorsal and one ventral, and their hub areas: the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the left medial frontal pole (mFP). These hub areas did not modulate their mutual functional connectivity following sadness but they did so through an interposed area, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC). Our results identify dlPFC and mFP as areas regulating interactions between emotional and cognitive networks, and suggest that their modulation by sadness experience is mediated by sACC.},

Numerous studies have suggested that depression and addiction share common mechanisms and anatomical pathways. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been considered a key brain region for regulating many behaviors, especially those related to depression and addiction. In this review article, we focus on the association between addiction and depression, highlighting the potential mediating role of the NAc in this comorbidity via the regulation of changes in the neural circuits and molecular signaling. To clarify the mechanisms underlying this association, we summarize evidence from overlapping reward neurocircuitry, the resemblance of cellular and molecular mechanisms, and common treatments. Understanding the interplay between these disorders should help guide clinical comorbidity prevention and the search for a new target for comorbidity treatment.},

Here we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) in humans and macaques to infer and compare the organization of dorsal frontal cortex in the two species. Using DW-MRI tractography-based parcellation, we identified 10 dorsal frontal regions lying between the human inferior frontal sulcus and cingulate cortex. Patterns of functional coupling between each area and the rest of the brain were then estimated with fMRI and compared with functional coupling patterns in macaques. Areas in human medial frontal cortex, including areas associated with high-level social cognitive processes such as theory of mind, showed a surprising degree of similarity in their functional coupling patterns with the frontal pole, medial prefrontal, and dorsal prefrontal convexity in the macaque. We failed to find evidence for “new” regions in human medial frontal cortex. On the lateral surface, comparison of functional coupling patterns suggested correspondences in anatomical organization distinct from those that are widely assumed. A human region sometimes referred to as lateral frontal pole more closely resembled area 46, rather than the frontal pole, of the macaque. Overall the pattern of results suggest important similarities in frontal cortex organization in humans and other primates, even in the case of regions thought to carry out uniquely human functions. The patterns of interspecies correspondences are not, however, always those that are widely assumed.},

Only through a comparative approach that encompasses work at the molecular, cellular, systems, and cognitive levels will we be able to comprehend what emotions do, how they evolved, how the brain shapes their development, and even how we might engineer them into robots in the future. Showing that emotions are ubiquitous across species and implemented in specific brain circuits, Adolphs and Anderson offer a broad foundation for thinking about emotions as evolved, functionally defined biological states. The authors discuss the techniques and findings from modern neuroscientific investigations of emotion and conclude with a survey of theories and future research directions.

This taxonomy identifies three general classes of antecedents to hedonic decline: physiological feedback, perceptual changes, and self-reflection. For each class, we review the supporting evidence for specifically identified antecedents and recent developments on how each antecedent influences hedonic decline.

	volume = {76},
	abstract = {Some have claimed that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates decision making. Others suggest mPFC is selectively involved in the retrieval of remote long-term memory. Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.},

As the positive and negative valence of feelings, hedonics are core processes that accompany emotion, motivation, and bodily states. Here, the affective neuroscience of pleasure and displeasure that has largely focused on the investigation of reward and pain processing, is reviewed. We describe the neurobiological systems of hedonics and factors that modulate hedonic experiences (e.g., cognition, learning, sensory input). Further, we review maladaptive and adaptive pleasure and displeasure functions in mental disorders and well-being, as well as the experience of aesthetics. As a centerpiece of the Human Affectome Project, language used to express pleasure and displeasure was also analyzed, and showed that most of these analyzed words overlap with expressions of emotions, actions, and bodily states. Our review shows that hedonics are typically investigated as processes that accompany other functions, but the mechanisms of hedonics (as core processes) have not been fully elucidated.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07584.x},
	abstract = {Data acquired with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are often interpreted in terms of the underlying neuronal activity, despite mounting evidence that these signals do not always correlate with electrophysiological recordings. Therefore, considering the increasing popularity of functional neuroimaging, it is clear that a more comprehensive theory is needed to reconcile these apparent disparities and more accurately explain the mechanisms through which various PET and fMRI signals arise. In the present article, we have turned our attention to astrocytes, which vastly outnumber neurons and are known to serve a number of functions throughout the central nervous system (CNS). For example, astrocytes are known to be critically involved in neurotransmitter uptake and recycling, and empirical data suggests that brain activation increases both oxidative and glycolytic astrocyte metabolism. Furthermore, a number of recent studies imply that astrocytes are likely to play a key role in regulating cerebral blood delivery. Therefore, we propose that, by mediating neurometabolic and neurovascular processes throughout the CNS, astrocytes could provide a common physiological basis for fMRI and PET signals. Such a theory has significant implications for the interpretation of functional neuroimaging signals, because astrocytic changes reflect subthreshold neuronal activity, simultaneous excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs, and other transient metabolic demands that may not elicit electrophysiological changes. It also suggests that fMRI and PET signals may have inherently less sensitivity to decreases in synaptic input (i.e. 'negative activity') and/or inhibitory (GABAergic) neurotransmission. © 2011 The Authors.

The theories of the universal cerebellar transform and dysmetria of thought and the principles of organization of cerebral cortical connections, together with neuroanatomical, brain imaging, and clinical observations, have recontextualized the cerebellum as a critical node in the distributed neural circuits subserving behavior. The framework for cerebellar cognition stems from the identification of three cognitive representations in the posterior lobe, which are interconnected with cerebral association areas and distinct from the primary and secondary cerebellar sensorimotor representations linked with the spinal cord and cerebral motor areas. Lesions of the anterior lobe primary sensorimotor representations produce dysmetria of movement, the cerebellar motor syndrome. Lesions of the posterior lobe cognitive-emotional cerebellum produce dysmetria of thought and emotion, the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome. The notion that the cerebellum modulates thought and emotion in the same way that it modulates motor control advances the understanding of the mechanisms of cognition and opens new therapeutic opportunities in behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry.},

	abstract = {The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

Models that learn via changes to connections help explain this organization. These models discover the structure in ensembles of items if learning of each item is gradual and interleaved with learning about other items. This suggests that the neocortex learns slowly to discover the structure in ensembles of experiences.

Importantly, clinical improvements can last for months or years after treatment. It has been theorized that these long-term improvements arise because psychedelics rapidly and lastingly stimulate neuroplasticity. The focus of this review is on answering specific questions about the effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity. Firstly, we review the evidence that psychedelics promote neuroplasticity and examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the effects of different psychedelics on different aspects of neuroplasticity, including dendritogenesis, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and expression of plasticity-related genes (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor and immediate early genes). We then examine where in the brain psychedelics promote neuroplasticity, particularly discussing the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We also examine what doses are required to produce this effect (e.g., hallucinogenic doses vs. “microdoses”), and how long purported changes in neuroplasticity last. Finally, we discuss the likely consequences of psychedelics' effects on neuroplasticity for both patients and healthy people, and we identify important research questions that would further scientific understanding of psychedelics' effects on neuroplasticity and its potential clinical applications.},

We show that our approach is theoretically well-founded and that it exhibits favourable latent representations on a synthetic manifold as well as on real-world image data sets, while preserving low reconstruction errors.},

	abstract = {In changing environments, animals must adaptively select actions to achieve their goals. In tasks involving goal-directed action selection, striatal neural activity has been shown to represent the value of competing actions. Striatal representations of action value could potentially bias responses toward actions of higher value. However, no study to date has demonstrated the direct effect of distinct striatal pathways in goal-directed action selection. We found that transient optogenetic stimulation of dorsal striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons during decision-making in mice introduced opposing biases in the distribution of choices. The effect of stimulation on choice was dependent on recent reward history and mimicked an additive change in the action value. Although stimulation before and during movement initiation produced a robust bias in choice behavior, this bias was substantially diminished when stimulation was delayed after response initiation. Together, our data suggest that striatal activity is involved in goal-directed action selection.},

	abstract = {A key component of the flexibility and complexity of the brain is its ability to dynamically adapt its functional network structure between integrated and segregated brain states depending on the demands of different cognitive tasks. Integrated states are prevalent when performing tasks of high complexity, such as maintaining items in working memory, consistent with models of a global workspace architecture. Recent work has suggested that the balance between integration and segregation is under the control of ascending neuromodulatory systems, such as the noradrenergic system, via changes in neural gain (in terms of the amplification and non-linearity in stimulus-response transfer function of brain regions). In a previous large-scale nonlinear oscillator model of neuronal network dynamics, we showed that manipulating neural gain parameters led to a `critical' transition in phase synchrony that was associated with a shift from segregated to integrated topology, thus confirming our original prediction. In this study, we advance these results by demonstrating that the gain-mediated phase transition is characterized by a shift in the underlying dynamics of neural information processing. Specifically, the dynamics of the subcritical (segregated) regime are dominated by information storage, whereas the supercritical (integrated) regime is associated with increased information transfer (measured via transfer entropy). Operating near to the critical regime with respect to modulating neural gain parameters would thus appear to provide computational advantages, offering flexibility in the information processing that can be performed with only subtle changes in gain control. Our results thus link studies of whole-brain network topology and the ascending arousal system with information processing dynamics, and suggest that the constraints imposed by the ascending arousal system constrain low-dimensional modes of information processing within the brain.},

	volume = {384},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties, but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of ¿50\%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95\% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70\% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48\% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95\% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57\% and 28\%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95\% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is thought to result from impaired connectivity between key brain networks. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, working primarily via GABAA receptors, with an important role in virtually all physiologic functions in the brain. Some neuroactive steroids (NASs) are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAA receptors and potentiate phasic and tonic inhibitory responses via activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, respectively. This review first discusses preclinical and clinical data that support the association of depression with diverse defects in the GABAergic system of neurotransmission. Decreased levels of GABA and NASs have been observed in adults with depression compared with healthy controls, while treatment with antidepressants normalized the altered levels of GABA and NASs. Second, as there has been intense interest in treatment approaches for depression that target dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission, we discuss NASs approved or currently in clinical development for the treatment of depression. Brexanolone, an intravenous NAS and a GABAA receptor PAM, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in patients 15 years and older. Other NASs include zuranolone, an investigational oral GABAA receptor PAM, and PH10, which acts on nasal chemosensory receptors; clinical data to date have shown improvement in depressive symptoms with these investigational NASs in adults with MDD or PPD. Finally, the review discusses how NAS GABAA receptor PAMs may potentially address the unmet need for novel and effective treatments with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with MDD.},

	abstract = {Persistent homology can extract hidden topological signals present in brain networks. Persistent homology summarizes the changes of topological structures over multiple different scales called filtrations. Doing so detect hidden topological signals that persist over multiple scales. The topological changes are then summarized into topological features such as the persistent diagrams. The topological dissimilarity is then measured through the Wasserstein distance between the persistent diagrams. Since the Wasserstein distance does not follow a known distribution, it is challenging to apply existing parametric methods for statistically quantifying the distance in brain network studies. To address this problem, we present a unified topological inference framework on the Wasserstein distance. Our approach has no explicit model and distributional assumptions. The inference is performed in a completely data driven fashion. The method is applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI) of the temporal lobe epilepsy patients collected at two different sites: University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Medical College of Wisconsin. However, the topological method is robust to variations due to sex and acquisition, and thus there is no need to account for sex and site as nuisance covariates. We are able to localize brain regions that contribute the most to topological differences. We made MATLAB package available at https://github.com/laplcebeltrami/dynamicTDA that was used to perform all the analysis in this study.},

The continuous dynamical systems considered are ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For hybrid systems we concentrate on models that combine ODEs and discrete dynamics (e.g., finite automata). We review and compare four such models from the literature. Notions of simulation of a discrete dynamical system by a continuous one are developed. We show that hybrid systems whose equations can describe a precise binary timing pulse (exact clock) can simulate arbitrary reversible discrete dynamical systems defined on closed subsets of Rn. The simulations require continuous ODEs in R2n with the exact clock as input. All four hybrid systems models studied here can implement exact clocks. We also prove that any discrete dynamical system in Zn can be simulated by continuous ODEs in R2n + 1. We use this to show that smooth ODEs in R3 can simulate arbitrary Turing machines, and hence possess the power of universal computation. We use the famous asynchronous arbiter problem to distinguish between hybrid and continuous dynamical systems. We prove that one cannot build an arbiter with devices described by a system of Lipschitz ODEs. On the other hand, all four hybrid systems models considered can implement arbiters even if their ODEs are Lipschitz.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {AbstractPsilocybin is a classic psychedelic compound that may have efficacy for the treatment of mood and substance use disorders. Acute psilocybin effects include reduced negative mood, increased positive mood, and reduced amygdala response to negative affective stimuli. However, no study has investigated the long-term, enduring impact of psilocybin on negative affect and associated brain function. Twelve healthy volunteers (7F/5M) completed an open-label pilot study including assessments 1-day before, 1-week after, and 1-month after receiving a 25 mg/70 kg dose of psilocybin to test the hypothesis that psilocybin administration leads to enduring changes in affect and neural correlates of affect. One-week post-psilocybin, negative affect and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli were reduced, whereas positive affect and dorsal lateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally-conflicting stimuli were increased. One-month post-psilocybin, negative affective and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli returned to baseline levels while positive affect remained elevated, and trait anxiety was reduced. Finally, the number of significant resting-state functional connections across the brain increased from baseline to 1-week and 1-month post-psilocybin. These preliminary findings suggest that psilocybin may increase emotional and brain plasticity, and the reported findings support the hypothesis that negative affect may be a therapeutic target for psilocybin.},

	title = {Emotion and motivation: the role of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex},
	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Emotions are multifaceted, but a key aspect of emotion involves the assessment of the value of environmental stimuli. This article reviews the many psychological representations, including representations of stimulus value, which are formed in the brain during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning tasks. These representations may be related directly to the functions of cortical and subcortical neural structures. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) appears to be required for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) to gain access to the current value of the specific unconditioned stimulus (US) that it predicts, while the central nucleus of the amygdala acts as a controller of brainstem arousal and response systems, and subserves some forms of stimulus-response Pavlovian conditioning. The nucleus accumbens, which appears not to be required for knowledge of the contingency between instrumental actions and their outcomes, nevertheless influences instrumental behaviour strongly by allowing Pavlovian CSs to affect the level of instrumental responding (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer), and is required for the normal ability of animals to choose rewards that are delayed. The prelimbic cortex is required for the detection of instrumental action-outcome contingencies, while insular cortex may allow rats to retrieve the values of specific foods via their sensory properties. The orbitofrontal cortex, like the BLA, may represent aspects of reinforcer value that govern instrumental choice behaviour. Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex, implicated in human disorders of emotion and attention, may have multiple roles in responding to the emotional significance of stimuli and to errors in performance, preventing responding to inappropriate stimuli.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {Serotonin modulates diverse brain functions. Beyond its clinical antidepressant effects, it improves motor performance, learning and memory formation. These effects might at least be partially caused by the impact of serotonin on neuroplasticity, which is thought to be an important foundation of the respective functions. In principal accordance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors enhance long-term potentiation-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans. As other neuromodulators have discernable effects on different kinds of plasticity in humans, here we were interested to explore the impact of serotonin on paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced plasticity, which induces a more focal kind of plasticity, as compared with tDCS, shares some features with spike timing-dependent plasticity, and is thought to be relative closely related to learning processes. In this single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, we administered a single dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo medication and applied facilitatory- and excitability-diminishing PAS to the left motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects. Cortico-spinal excitability was explored via single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited MEP amplitudes up to the next evening after plasticity induction. After citalopram administration, inhibitory PAS-induced after-effects were abolished and excitatory PAS-induced after-effects were enhanced trendwise, as compared with the respective placebo conditions. These results show that serotonin modulates PAS-induced neuroplasticity by shifting it into the direction of facilitation, which might help to explain mechanism of positive therapeutic effects of serotonin in learning and medical conditions characterized by enhanced inhibitory or reduced facilitatory plasticity, including depression and stroke.},

	abstract = {Dopamine has been implicated in value-based learning and decision making by signaling reward prediction errors and facilitating cognitive flexibility, incentive motivation, and voluntary movement. Dopamine receptors can roughly be divided into the D1 and D2 subtypes, and it has been hypothesized that these two types of receptors have an opposite function in facilitating reward-related and aversion-related behaviors, respectively. Here, we tested the contribution of striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors to processes underlying value-based learning and decision making in rats, employing a probabilistic reversal learning paradigm. Using computational trial-by-trial analysis of task behavior after systemic or intracranial treatment with dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists and antagonists, we show that negative feedback learning can be modulated through D2 receptor signaling and positive feedback learning through D1 receptor signaling in the ventral striatum. Furthermore, stimulation of D2 receptors in the ventral or dorsolateral (but not dorsomedial) striatum promoted explorative choice behavior, suggesting an additional function of dopamine in these areas in value-based decision making. Finally, treatment with most dopaminergic drugs affected response latencies and number of trials completed, which was also seen after infusion of D2, but not D1 receptor-acting drugs into the striatum. Together, our data support the idea that dopamine D1 and D2 receptors have complementary functions in learning on the basis of emotionally valenced feedback, and provide evidence that dopamine facilitates value-based and motivated behaviors through distinct striatal regions.},

We also show that any Turing machine can be simulated by a two-dimensional C ∞ ordinary differential equation on the compact sphere S 2 .},

Prominently, the brain is one such case. With the aim of relating information and dynamics in biological neural systems, we study a model network of spiking neurons with different coupling configurations, and explore the relation between its informational, dynamical, and topological properties. We find that information transfer and storage peak at two separate points for different values of the coupling parameter, and are balanced at an intermediate point. In this configuration, avalanches in the network follow a long-tailed, power law-like distribution. Furthermore, the avalanche statistics at this point reproduce empirical findings in the biological brain.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the structural difference in regional gray matter density (GMD) between 22 first-episode MDD patients and 30 age-, gender- and education-matched healthy controls by optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) based on magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, MDD patients showed decreased GMD in the right medial and left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral temporal pole, right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral anterior insular cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left cerebellum. In addition, in MDD patients, there was a negative correlation between GMD values of the right DLPFC and the score of the depression rating scale. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided additional support for the involvement of limbic-cortical circuits in the pathophysiology of MDD and preliminary evidence that a defect involving the cerebellum may also be implicated.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression is the most common mental illness worldwide. It has become an important public health problem. This study aimed to determine the global burden of depression and how it has changed between 1990 and 2017. METHODS: We used information on depression obtained by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study from 1990 to 2017. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were used to assess the global burden of depression. RESULTS: The number of incident cases of depression worldwide increased from 172 million in 1990 to 25,8 million in 2017, representing an increase of 49.86\%. The ASR of depression varied widely between the 195 analyzed countries and regions in 2017, being highest in Lesotho (6.59 per 1000) and lowest in Myanmar (1.28 per 1000). The ASR increased the most between 1990 and 2017 in Belgium (EAPC = 0.88, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78 to 0.97), and decreased the most in Cuba (EAPC = -1.26, 95\% CI = -1.36 to -1.14). The ASR increased in regions with a high sociodemographic index, such as high-income North America (EAPC = 0.41, 95\% CI = 0.31 to 0.51), and decreased significantly in South Asia (EAPC = -0.63, 95\% CI = -0.85 to -0.41). The proportions of the population with major depressive disorder and dysthymia were essentially stable both globally and in various countries, with a much larger proportion having major depressive disorder. CONCLUSION: Depression remains a major public health issue, and governments should support the research necessary to develop better prevention and treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated “reverse engineering” approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.},

How the cerebral cortex learns efficiently despite the sparse nature of feedback remains unclear. Inspired by recent deep learning algorithms, we introduce a systems-level computational model of cerebro-cerebellar interactions. In this model a cerebral recurrent network receives feedback predictions from a cerebellar network, thereby decoupling learning in cerebral networks from future feedback. When trained in a simple sensorimotor task the model shows faster learning and reduced dysmetria-like behaviours, in line with the widely observed functional impact of the cerebellum. Next, we demonstrate that these results generalise to more complex motor and cognitive tasks. Finally, the model makes several experimentally testable predictions regarding cerebro-cerebellar task-specific representations over learning, task-specific benefits of cerebellar predictions and the differential impact of cerebellar and inferior olive lesions. Overall, our work offers a theoretical framework of cerebro-cerebellar networks as feedback decoupling machines.},

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people worldwide suffer from this disorder, being the leading cause of disability. The advancements in electroencephalography (EEG) make it a powerful tool for non-invasive studies on neurological disorders including depression. Scientific community has used EEG to better understand the mechanisms behind the disorder and find biomarkers, which are characteristics that can be precisely measured in order to identify or diagnose a disorder. This work presents a systematic mapping of recent studies ranging from 2014 to the end of 2018 which use non-invasive EEG to detect depression biomarkers. Our research has analyzed more than 250 articles and we discuss the findings and promising biomarkers of 42 studies, finding that the depressed brain appear to have a more random network structure, also finding promising features for diagnostic, such as, gamma band and signal complexity; among others which may detect specific depression-related symptoms such as suicidal ideation.},

Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.},

While the emergence of complex sciences in the turn of the millennium have resulted in their implementation in modelling epidemics, there is still a need for improving our understanding of critical dynamics in epidemics. In this study, using agent-based modelling, we simulate a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic on a homogeneous network. We use transfer entropy and active information storage from information dynamics framework to characterise the critical transition in epidemiological models. Our study shows that both (bias-corrected) transfer entropy and active information storage maximise after the critical threshold ( R 0 = 1). This is the first step toward an information dynamics approach to epidemics. Understanding the dynamics around the criticality in epidemiological models can provide us insights about emergent diseases and disease control.},

Advances in sparse regression are currently enabling the tractable identification of both the structure and parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. The resulting models have the fewest terms necessary to describe the dynamics, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability, and thus promoting interpretability and generalizability. This provides an algorithmic approach to Occam's razor for model discovery. However, this approach fundamentally relies on an effective coordinate system in which the dynamics have a simple representation. In this work, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to discover a coordinate transformation into a reduced space where the dynamics may be sparsely represented. Thus, we simultaneously learn the governing equations and the associated coordinate system. We demonstrate this approach on several example high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional behavior. The resulting modeling framework combines the strengths of deep neural networks for flexible representation and sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for parsimonious models. This method places the discovery of coordinates and models on an equal footing.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have contributed significantly to our understanding of brain function. Current methods are based on the analysis of gradual and continuous changes in the brain blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signal. Departing from that approach, recent work has shown that equivalent results can be obtained by inspecting only the relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks, suggesting that relevant information can be condensed in discrete events. This idea is further explored here to demonstrate how brain dynamics at resting state can be captured just by the timing and location of such events, i.e., in terms of a spatiotemporal point process. The method allows, for the first time, to define a theoretical framework in terms of an order and control parameter derived from fMRI data, where the dynamical regime can be interpreted as one corresponding to a system close to the critical point of a second order phase transition. The analysis demonstrates that the resting brain spends most of the time near the critical point of such transition and exhibits avalanches of activity ruled by the same dynamical and statistical properties described previously for neuronal events at smaller scales. Given the demonstrated functional relevance of the resting state brain dynamics, its representation as a discrete process might facilitate large-scale analysis of brain function both in health and disease.},

	abstract = {The lateral hypothalamic (LH) projection to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been linked to reward processing, but the computations within the LH-VTA loop that give rise to specific aspects of behavior have been difficult to isolate. We show that LH-VTA neurons encode the learned action of seeking a reward, independent of reward availability. In contrast, LH neurons downstream of VTA encode reward-predictive cues and unexpected reward omission. We show that inhibiting the LH-VTA pathway reduces “compulsive” sucrose seeking but not food consumption in hungry mice. We reveal that the LH sends excitatory and inhibitory input onto VTA dopamine (DA) and GABA neurons, and that the GABAergic projection drives feeding-related behavior. Our study overlays information about the type, function, and connectivity of LH neurons and identifies a neural circuit that selectively controls compulsive sugar consumption, without preventing feeding necessary for survival, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions for compulsive-overeating disorder.},

	title = {Deep {CANALs}: {A} deep learning approach to refining the canalization theory of psychopathology},
	abstract = {Psychedelic therapy has seen a resurgence of interest in the past decade, with promising clinical outcomes for treatment of a variety of psychopathologies. In response to this success, a number of theoretical models have been proposed to account for psychedelic's positive therapeutic effects. One of the more prominent models is `RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics,' (REBUS) which suggests that psychedelics act therapeutically by relaxing the strength of maladaptive high-level beliefs encoded in the brain. The more recent `CANAL' model of psychopathology builds on the explanatory framework of REBUS by proposing that canalization (the development of overly rigid belief landscapes) may be a primary factor in psychopathology. Here we take inspiration from learning theory in deep neural networks to develop a series of refinements to the original CANAL model. Our primary theoretical contribution is to disambiguate two separate optimization landscapes underlying belief representation, and describe the unique pathologies which can arise from the canalization of each. Along each dimension we identify pathologies of either too much or too little canalization, suggesting that at the very least canalization does not have a linear relationship with psychopathology. In this expanded paradigm, we demonstrate the ability to make novel predictions regarding which psychopathologies may be amenable to psychedelic therapy, as well as what forms of psychedelic therapy may ultimately be most beneficial for a given individual.},

	volume = {37},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown mixed results for depression treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials using tDCS to improve depressive symptoms. METHODS: A systematic review was performed from the first date available to January 06, 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and additional sources. We included randomized, sham-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) enrolling participants with an acute depressive episode and compared the efficacy of active versus sham tDCS, including association with other interventions. The primary outcome was the Hedges' g for continuous depression scores; secondary outcomes included odds ratios (ORs) and number needed to treat (NNT) for response, remission, and acceptability. Random effects models were employed. Sources of heterogeneity were explored via metaregression, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and bias assessment. RESULTS: We included 23 RCTs (25 datasets, 1,092 participants), most (57\%) presenting a low risk of bias. Active tDCS was superior to sham regarding endpoint depression scores (k = 25, g = 0.46, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22-0.70), and also achieved superior response (k = 18, 33.3\% vs. 16.56\%, OR = 2.28 [1.52-3.42], NNT = 6) and remission (k = 18, 19.12\% vs. 9.78\%, OR = 2.12 [1.42-3.16], NNT = 10.7) rates. Moreover, active tDCS was as acceptable as sham. No risk of publication bias was identified. Cumulative meta-analysis showed that effect sizes are basically unchanged since total sample reached 439 participants. CONCLUSIONS: TDCS is modestly effective in treating depressive episodes. Further well-designed, large-scale RCTs are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: The main purpose of this study is to present and evaluate a new, extraordinary means of appeal in Polish criminal procedure – a complaint against cassatory judgment of the appellate court from the point of view of principles of criminal proceedings. This includes hearing the case within a reasonable time, the right of defence, two-instance proceedings, and equality of arms in complaint proceedings. Methods: This study draws on comprehensive analyses of the provisions of the Polish Code of Criminal Procedure, partly based on case research, and comparing effects of these analyses with both the Polish constitutional standard and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Results: Complaint proceedings comply with the main requirements of a fair trial. Conclusions: Certain limitations on the right of the accused in the discussed proceedings are fully justified by their special features and are proportionate. This conclusion applies to the time-limit for submitting the complaint, the requirement to bring it only through the assistance of a defence counsel, and also to the way of examination of the complaint by the Supreme Court in writing at the closed session. All these solutions constitute only permissible, proportionate restrictions of the indicated principles. This proportionality results primarily from weighing the benefits of the complaint proceedings: limitations of cassatory adjudication in genere, respect for the appeal model of appellate proceedings, and maintaining uniformity of interpretation of narrowly defined grounds for cassatory adjudication.},

	volume = {98},
	abstract = {A baseline or control state is fundamental to the understanding of most complex systems. Defining a baseline state in the human brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the existence of an organized, baseline default mode of brain function that is suspended during specific goal-directed behaviors.},

Here, we introduce a Bayesian machine scientist, which establishes the plausibility of models using explicit approximations to the exact marginal posterior over models and establishes its prior expectations about models by learning from a large empirical corpus of mathematical expressions. It explores the space of models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach uncovers accurate models for synthetic and real data and provides out-of-sample predictions that are more accurate than those of existing approaches and of other nonparametric methods.},

	abstract = {The ability to differentiate stimuli predicting positive or negative outcomes is critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing underlie many psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive and negative associations within the amygdala.},

Objective: To undertake a systematic test of the validity of a proposed cognitive biotype of MDD across neural circuit, symptom, social occupational function, and treatment outcome modalities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial implemented data-driven clustering in findings from the International Study to Predict Optimized Treatment in Depression, a pragmatic biomarker trial in which patients with MDD were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to antidepressant treatment with escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended-release and assessed at baseline and 8 weeks on multimodal outcomes between December 1, 2008, and September 30, 2013. Eligible patients were medication-free outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD in at least the moderate range, and were recruited from 17 clinical and academic practices; a subset of these patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. This prespecified secondary analysis was performed between June 10, 2022, and April 21, 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pretreatment and posttreatment behavioral measures of cognitive performance across 9 domains, depression symptoms assessed using 2 standard depression scales, and psychosocial function assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale and World Health Organization Quality of Life scale were analyzed. Neural circuit function engaged during a cognitive control task was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: A total of 1008 patients (571 [56.6\%] female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.6] years) participated in the overall trial and 96 patients participated in the imaging substudy (45 [46.7\%] female; mean [SD] age, 34.5 [13.5] years). Cluster analysis identified what may be referred to as a cognitive biotype of 27\% of depressed patients with prominent behavioral impairment in executive function and response inhibition domains of cognitive control. This biotype was characterized by a specific profile of pretreatment depressive symptoms, worse psychosocial functioning (d = -0.25; 95\% CI, -0.39 to -0.11; P ¡ .001), and reduced activation of the cognitive control circuit (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: d = -0.78; 95\% CI, -1.28 to -0.27; P = .003). Remission was comparatively lower in the cognitive biotype positive subgroup (73 of 188 [38.8\%] vs 250 of 524 [47.7\%]; P = .04) and cognitive impairments persisted regardless of symptom change (executive function: ηp2 = 0.241; P ¡ .001; response inhibition: ηp2 = 0.750; P ¡ .001). The extent of symptom and functional change was specifically mediated by change in cognition but not the reverse. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest the presence of a cognitive biotype of depression with distinct neural correlates, and a functional clinical profile that responds poorly to standard antidepressants and instead may benefit from therapies specifically targeting cognitive dysfunction.

	abstract = {A growing interest in cerebellar function and its involvement in higher cognition have prompted much research in recent years. Cerebellar presence in a wide range of cognitive functions examined within an increasing body of neuroimaging literature has been observed. We applied a meta-analytic approach, which employed the activation likelihood estimate method, to consolidate results of cerebellar involvement accumulated in different cognitive tasks of interest and systematically identified similarities among the studies. The current analysis included 88 neuroimaging studies demonstrating cerebellar activations in higher cognitive domains involving emotion, executive function, language, music, timing and working memory. While largely consistent with a prior meta-analysis by Stoodley and Schmahmann ([2009]: Neuroimage 44:489-501), our results extended their findings to include music and timing domains to provide further insights into cerebellar involvement and elucidate its role in higher cognition. In addition, we conducted inter- and intradomain comparisons for the cognitive domains of emotion, language, and working memory. We also considered task differences within the domain of verbal working memory by conducting a comparison of the Sternberg with the n-back task, as well as an analysis of the differential components within the Sternberg task. Results showed a consistent cerebellar presence in the timing domain, providing evidence for a role in time keeping. Unique clusters identified within the domain further refine the topographic organization of the cerebellum.},

We investigated whether tDCS-induced E-field strength of distinct tDCS parameters was associated with antidepressant effect. A meta-analysis was performed with tDCS placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling MDD patients. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 10, 2023. Effect sizes of tDCS protocols were correlated with E-field simulations (SimNIBS) of brain regions of interest (bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)). Moderators of tDCS responses were also investigated. A total of twenty studies were included (21 datasets, 1008 patients) using eleven distinct tDCS protocols. Results revealed a moderate effect for MDD (g=0.41, 95\% CI [0.18,0.64]), while cathode position and treatment strategy were found to be moderators of response. A negative association between the effect size and tDCS-induced E-field magnitude was seen, showing that stronger E-fields in the right frontal and medial parts of the DLPFC (targeted by the cathode) led to smaller effects. No association was found for the left DLPFC and the bilateral sgACC. An optimized tDCS protocol was presented.},

	abstract = {A complete neuroscience requires multilevel theories that address phenomena ranging from higher-level cognitive behaviors to activities within a cell. We propose an extension to the level of mechanism approach where a computational model of cognition sits in between behavior and brain: It explains the higher-level behavior and can be decomposed into lower-level component mechanisms to provide a richer understanding of the system than any level alone. Toward this end, we decomposed a cognitive model into neuron-like units using a neural flocking approach that parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. Neural flocking coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs. The decomposed model suggested how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations and why so many neurons are needed for robust performance at the cognitive level. This multilevel explanation provides a way to understand how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural populations (assemblies) formed through learning.},

	abstract = {Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with abnormal neural circuitry. It can be measured by assessing functional connectivity (FC) at resting-state functional MRI, that may help identifying neural markers of MDD and provide further efficient diagnosis and monitor treatment outcomes. The main aim of the present study is to investigate, in an unbiased way, functional alterations in patients with MDD using a large multi-center dataset from the PsyMRI consortium including 1546 participants from 19 centers ( www.psymri.com ). After applying strict exclusion criteria, the final sample consisted of 606 MDD patients (age: 35.8 ± 11.9 y.o.; females: 60.7\%) and 476 healthy participants (age: 33.3 ± 11.0 y.o.; females: 56.7\%). We found significant relative hypoconnectivity within somatosensory motor (SMN), salience (SN) networks and between SMN, SN, dorsal attention (DAN), and visual (VN) networks in MDD patients. No significant differences were detected within the default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal networks (FPN). In addition, alterations in network organization were observed in terms of significantly lower network segregation of SMN in MDD patients. Although medicated patients showed significantly lower FC within DMN, FPN, and SN than unmedicated patients, there were no differences between medicated and unmedicated groups in terms of network organization in SMN. We conclude that the network organization of cortical networks, involved in processing of sensory information, might be a more stable neuroimaging marker for MDD than previously assumed alterations in higher-order neural networks like DMN and FPN.},

@article{Tononi2004,
	title = {An information integration theory of consciousness},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition? PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi¿0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

Humans tend to find the physical stance more helpful for certain systems, such as planets orbiting a star, and the intentional stance for others, such as living animals. We define a formal counterpart of physical and intentional stances within computational theory: a description of a system as either a device, or an agent, with the key difference being that `devices' are directly described in terms of an input-output mapping, while `agents' are described in terms of the function they optimise. Bayes' rule can then be applied to calculate the subjective probability of a system being a device or an agent, based only on its behaviour. We illustrate this using the trajectories of an object in a toy grid-world domain.},

	abstract = {A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, we develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. We apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, we improve the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90\%.},

Next, we proceed with a more contemporary discussion of core affect as a basic property of the mind that is realized within a broadly distributed neuronal workspace. We then present the affective circumplex, a mathematical formalization for representing core affective states, and show that this model can be used to represent individual differences in core affective feelings that are linked to meaningful variation in emotional experience. Finally, we conclude by suggesting that core affect has psychological consequences that reach beyond the boundaries of emotion, to influence learning and consciousness.},

	abstract = {Neural complexity and brain entropy (BEN) have gained greater interest in recent years. The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The BEN of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis.” In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated BEN in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where BEN is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of BEN in primary states and cognitive aging.},

	title = {Brain structural and functional abnormalities in mood disorders: implications for neurocircuitry models of depression},
	volume = {213},
	abstract = {The neural networks that putatively modulate aspects of normal emotional behavior have been implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders by converging evidence from neuroimaging, neuropathological and lesion analysis studies. These networks involve the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and closely related areas in the medial and caudolateral orbital cortex (medial prefrontal network), amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial parts of the basal ganglia, where alterations in grey matter volume and neurophysiological activity are found in cases with recurrent depressive episodes. Such findings hold major implications for models of the neurocircuits that underlie depression. In particular evidence from lesion analysis studies suggests that the MPFC and related limbic and striato-pallido-thalamic structures organize emotional expression. The MPFC is part of a larger “default system” of cortical areas that include the dorsal PFC, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal cortex, and entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, which has been implicated in self-referential functions. Dysfunction within and between structures in this circuit may induce disturbances in emotional behavior and other cognitive aspects of depressive syndromes in humans. Further, because the MPFC and related limbic structures provide forebrain modulation over visceral control structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem, their dysfunction can account for the disturbances in autonomic regulation and neuroendocrine responses that are associated with mood disorders. This paper discusses these systems together with the neurochemical systems that impinge on them and form the basis for most pharmacological therapies.},

@article{carhart-harrisCanalizationPlasticityPsychopathology2023,
	title = {Canalization and plasticity in psychopathology},
	volume = {226},
	abstract = {This theoretical article revives a classical bridging construct, canalization, to describe a new model of a general factor of psychopathology. To achieve this, we have distinguished between two types of plasticity, an early one that we call 'TEMP' for 'Temperature or Entropy Mediated Plasticity', and another, we call 'canalization', which is close to Hebbian plasticity. These two forms of plasticity can be most easily distinguished by their relationship to 'precision' or inverse variance; TEMP relates to increased model variance or decreased precision, whereas the opposite is true for canalization. TEMP also subsumes increased learning rate, (Ising) temperature and entropy. Dictionary definitions of 'plasticity' describe it as the property of being easily shaped or molded; TEMP is the better match for this. Importantly, we propose that 'pathological' phenotypes develop via mechanisms of canalization or increased model precision, as a defensive response to adversity and associated distress or dysphoria. Our model states that canalization entrenches in psychopathology, narrowing the phenotypic state-space as the agent develops expertise in their pathology. We suggest that TEMP - combined with gently guiding psychological support - can counter canalization. We address questions of whether and when canalization is adaptive versus maladaptive, furnish our model with references to basic and human neuroscience, and offer concrete experiments and measures to test its main hypotheses and implications.

We have now come closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence toward peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Serotonin affects memory formation via modulating long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Accordingly, acute selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration enhanced LTP-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans. However, it usually takes some time for SSRI to reduce clinical symptoms such as anxiety, negative mood, and related symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. This might be related to an at least partially different effect of chronic serotonergic enhancement on plasticity, as compared with single-dose medication. Here we explored the impact of chronic application of the SSRI citalopram (CIT) on plasticity induced by tDCS in healthy humans in a partially double-blinded, placebo (PLC)-controlled, randomized crossover study. Furthermore, we explored the dependency of plasticity induction from the glutamatergic system via N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonism. Twelve healthy subjects received PLC medication, combined with anodal or cathodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex. Afterwards, the same subjects took CIT (20 mg/day) consecutively for 35 days. During this period, four additional interventions were performed (CIT and PLC medication with anodal/cathodal tDCS, CIT and dextromethorphan (150 mg) with anodal/cathodal tDCS). Plasticity was monitored by motor-evoked potential amplitudes elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Chronic application of CIT increased and prolonged the LTP-like plasticity induced by anodal tDCS for over 24 h, and converted cathodal tDCS-induced LTD-like plasticity into facilitation.

Dealing with such complexities demands powerful techniques. Computational psychiatry combines multiple levels and types of computation with multiple types of data in an effort to improve understanding, prediction and treatment of mental illness. Computational psychiatry, broadly defined, encompasses two complementary approaches: data driven and theory driven. Data-driven approaches apply machine-learning methods to high-dimensional data to improve classification of disease, predict treatment outcomes or improve treatment selection. These approaches are generally agnostic as to the underlying mechanisms. Theory-driven approaches, in contrast, use models that instantiate prior knowledge of, or explicit hypotheses about, such mechanisms, possibly at multiple levels of analysis and abstraction. We review recent advances in both approaches, with an emphasis on clinical applications, and highlight the utility of combining them.},

This report argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive “indicator properties” of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.},

	abstract = {The neural substrates of consciousness remain elusive. Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Φ∗) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.},

	abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in developing models of cerebellar function in sensorimotor control, as well as in identifying key problems that are the focus of current investigation. In this consensus paper, we discuss the literature on the role of the cerebellar circuitry in motor control, bringing together a range of different viewpoints. The following topics are covered: oculomotor control, classical conditioning (evidence in animals and in humans), cerebellar control of motor speech, control of grip forces, control of voluntary limb movements, timing, sensorimotor synchronization, control of corticomotor excitability, control of movement-related sensory data acquisition, cerebro-cerebellar interaction in visuokinesthetic perception of hand movement, functional neuroimaging studies, and magnetoencephalographic mapping of cortico-cerebellar dynamics. While the field has yet to reach a consensus on the precise role played by the cerebellum in movement control, the literature has witnessed the emergence of broad proposals that address cerebellar function at multiple levels of analysis. This paper highlights the diversity of current opinion, providing a framework for debate and discussion on the role of this quintessential vertebrate structure.},

However, the neurophysiological basis of this effect is unclear so far. We studied the impact of this drug on long-lasting after-effects of transcranial direct current (tDCS)-generated motor cortical excitability shifts, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited motor-evoked potentials. While anodal tDCS enhances motor cortical excitability, cathodal tDCS diminishes it. Both effects seem to be NMDA receptor dependent. D-CYC selectively potentiated the duration of motor cortical excitability enhancements induced by anodal tDCS. D-CYC alone did not modulate excitability. The potency of this drug to consolidate neuronal excitability enhancements, most probably by stabilizing the strengthening of NMDA receptors, which is a probable neurophysiological derivate of learning processes, makes it an interesting substance to improve cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

The technique works as follows: we first encourage sparse latent representations when we train a GNN in a supervised setting, then we apply symbolic regression to components of the learned model to extract explicit physical relations. We find the correct known equations, including force laws and Hamiltonians, can be extracted from the neural network. We then apply our method to a non-trivial cosmology example-a detailed dark matter simulation-and discover a new analytic formula which can predict the concentration of dark matter from the mass distribution of nearby cosmic structures. The symbolic expressions extracted from the GNN using our technique also generalized to out-of-distribution data better than the GNN itself. Our approach offers alternative directions for interpreting neural networks and discovering novel physical principles from the representations they learn.},

	title = {Does the prefrontal cortex play an essential role in consciousness? {Insights} from intracranial electrical stimulation of the human brain},
	volume = {41},
	abstract = {A central debate in philosophy and neuroscience pertains to whether PFC activity plays an essential role in the neural basis of consciousness. Neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies have revealed that the contents of conscious perceptual experience can be successfully decoded from PFC activity, but these findings might be confounded by postperceptual cognitive processes, such as thinking, reasoning, and decision-making, that are not necessary for consciousness. To clarify the involvement of the PFC in consciousness, we present a synthesis of research that has used intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) for the causal modulation of neural activity in the human PFC. This research provides compelling evidence that iES of only certain prefrontal regions (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) reliably perturbs conscious experience. Conversely, stimulation of anterolateral prefrontal sites, often considered crucial in higher-order and global workspace theories of consciousness, seldom elicits any reportable alterations in consciousness. Furthermore, the wide variety of iES-elicited effects in the PFC (e.g., emotions, thoughts, and olfactory and visual hallucinations) exhibits no clear relation to the immediate environment. Therefore, there is no evidence for the kinds of alterations in ongoing perceptual experience that would be predicted by higher-order or global workspace theories. Nevertheless, effects in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices suggest a specific role for these PFC subregions in supporting emotional aspects of conscious experience. Overall, this evidence presents a challenge for higher-order and global workspace theories, which commonly point to the PFC as the basis for conscious perception based on correlative and possibly confounded information.},

	title = {Dosage-dependent impact of acute serotonin enhancement on transcranial direct current stimulation effects},
	volume = {24},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The serotonergic system has an important impact on basic physiological and higher brain functions. Acute and chronic enhancement of serotonin levels via selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor administration impacts neuroplasticity in humans, as shown by its effects on cortical excitability alterations induced by non-invasive brain stimulation, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Nevertheless, the interaction between serotonin activation and neuroplasticity is not fully understood, particularly considering dose-dependent effects. Our goal was to explore dosage-dependent effects of acute serotonin enhancement on stimulation-induced plasticity in healthy individuals. METHODS: Twelve healthy adults participated in 7 sessions conducted in a crossover, partially double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled study design. Anodal and cathodal tDCS was applied to the motor cortex under selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (20 mg/40 mg citalopram) or placebo medication. Motor cortex excitability was monitored by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. RESULTS: Under placebo medication, anodal tDCS enhanced, and cathodal tDCS reduced, excitability for approximately 60-120 minutes after the intervention. Citalopram enhanced and prolonged the facilitation induced by anodal tDCS regardless of the dosage while turning cathodal tDCS-induced excitability diminution into facilitation. For the latter, prolonged effects were observed when 40 mg was administrated. CONCLUSIONS: Acute serotonin enhancement modulates tDCS after-effects and has largely similar modulatory effects on motor cortex neuroplasticity regardless of the specific dosage. A minor dosage-dependent effect was observed only for cathodal tDCS. The present findings support the concept of boosting the neuroplastic effects of anodal tDCS by serotonergic enhancement, a potential clinical approach for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the “alphabet” used to describe those systems.},

And it is often followed by some very grim statistics. Over 300 million people in the world are estimated to live with depression, and the disorder is ranked by WHO as the single largest contributor to global disability. Most worryingly, adolescents with major depressive disorder are up to 30 times more likely to commit suicide. Yet, what exactly is depression? Do all 300 million depressed people in the world suffer from the same thing, with the same aetiology? Is depression one disorder that comes in different shades of severity or is it best thought of as heterogeneous mix of problems that we have given one common name to? And, more practically, should we be treating all depression in similar ways?},

	volume = {98},
	abstract = {We recently put forward an argument, the Unfolding Argument (UA), that integrated information theory (IIT) and other causal structure theories are either already falsified or unfalsifiable, which provoked significant criticism. It seems that we and the critics agree that the main question in this debate is whether first-person experience, independent of third-person data, is a sufficient foundation for theories of consciousness. Here, we argue that pure first-person experience cannot be a scientific foundation for IIT because science relies on taking measurements, and pure first-person experience is not measurable except through reports, brain activity, and the relationship between them. We also argue that pure first-person experience cannot be taken as ground truth because science is about backing up theories with data, not about asserting that we have ground truth independent of data. Lastly, we explain why no experiment based on third-person data can test IIT as a theory of consciousness. IIT may be a good theory of something, but not of consciousness. We conclude by exposing a deeper reason for the above conclusions: IIT's consciousness is by construction fully dissociated from any measurable thing and, for this reason, IIT implies that both the level and content of consciousness are epiphenomenal, with no causal power. IIT and other causal structure theories end up in a form of dissociative epiphenomenalism, in which we cannot even trust reports about first-person experiences. But reports about first-person experiences are taken as ground truth and the foundation for IIT's axioms. Therefore, accepting IIT leads to rejecting its own axioms. We also respond to several other criticisms against the UA.},

@article{lefaucheurEvidencebasedGuidelinesTherapeutic2017,
	title = {Evidence-based guidelines on the therapeutic use of transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS})},
	volume = {128},
	abstract = {A group of European experts was commissioned by the European Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology to gather knowledge about the state of the art of the therapeutic use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) from studies published up until September 2016, regarding pain, Parkinson's disease, other movement disorders, motor stroke, poststroke aphasia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, consciousness disorders, Alzheimer's disease, tinnitus, depression, schizophrenia, and craving/addiction. The evidence-based analysis included only studies based on repeated tDCS sessions with sham tDCS control procedure; 25 patients or more having received active treatment was required for Class I, while a lower number of 10–24 patients was accepted for Class II studies. Current evidence does not allow making any recommendation of Level A (definite efficacy) for any indication. Level B recommendation (probable efficacy) is proposed for: (i) anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in fibromyalgia; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in major depressive episode without drug resistance; (iii) anodal tDCS of the right DLPFC (with left DLPFC cathode) in addiction/craving. Level C recommendation (possible efficacy) is proposed for anodal tDCS of the left M1 (or contralateral to pain side, with right orbitofrontal cathode) in chronic lower limb neuropathic pain secondary to spinal cord lesion. Conversely, Level B recommendation (probable inefficacy) is conferred on the absence of clinical effects of: (i) anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in tinnitus; (ii) anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC (with right orbitofrontal cathode) in drug-resistant major depressive episode. It remains to be clarified whether the probable or possible therapeutic effects of tDCS are clinically meaningful and how to optimally perform tDCS in a therapeutic setting. In addition, the easy management and low cost of tDCS devices allow at home use by the patient, but this might raise ethical and legal concerns with regard to potential misuse or overuse. We must be careful to avoid inappropriate applications of this technique by ensuring rigorous training of the professionals and education of the patients.},

This is the question we investigate here. We show that this model-learning problem displays a transition from a low-noise phase in which the true model can be learned, to a phase in which the observation noise is too high for the true model to be learned by any method. Both in the low-noise phase and in the high-noise phase, probabilistic model selection leads to optimal generalization to unseen data. This is in contrast to standard machine learning approaches, including artificial neural networks, which are limited, in the low-noise phase, by their ability to interpolate. In the transition region between the learnable and unlearnable phases, generalization is hard for all approaches including probabilistic model selection.},

Here our focus is on the disruption in neuropsychiatric disorders (pathoconnectomics) and how whole-brain computational models can help generate and predict the dynamical interactions and consequences of brain networks over many timescales. We review methods and emerging results that exhibit remarkable accuracy in mapping and predicting both spontaneous and task-based healthy network dynamics. This raises great expectations that whole-brain modeling and computational connectomics may provide an entry point for understanding brain disorders at a causal mechanistic level, and that computational neuropsychiatry can ultimately be leveraged to provide novel, more effective therapeutic interventions, e.g., through drug discovery and new targets for deep brain stimulation.},

@article{jinHumanAmygdalaRepresents2015,
	title = {Human amygdala represents the complete spectrum of subjective valence},
	volume = {35},
	abstract = {Although the amygdala is a major locus for hedonic processing, how it encodes valence information is poorly understood. Given the hedonic potency of odor stimuli and the amygdala's anatomical proximity to the peripheral olfactory system, we combined high-resolution fMRI with pattern-based multivariate techniques to examine how valence information is encoded in the amygdala. Ten human subjects underwent fMRI scanning while smelling 9 odorants that systematically varied in perceived valence. Representational similarity analyses showed that amygdala codes the entire dimension of valence, ranging from pleasantness to unpleasantness. This unidimensional representation significantly correlated with self-reported valence ratings but not with intensity ratings. Furthermore, within-trial valence representations evolved over time, prioritizing earlier differentiation of unpleasant stimuli. Together, these findings underscore the idea that both spatial and temporal features uniquely encode pleasant and unpleasant odor valence in the amygdala. The availability of a unidimensional valence code in the amygdala, distributed in both space and time, would create greater flexibility in determining the pleasantness or unpleasantness of stimuli, providing a mechanism by which expectation, context, attention, and learning could influence affective boundaries for guiding behavior. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our findings elucidate the mechanisms of affective processing in the amygdala by demonstrating that this brain region represents the entire valence dimension from pleasant to unpleasant. An important implication of this unidimensional valence code is that pleasant and unpleasant valence cannot coexist in the amygdale because overlap of fMRI ensemble patterns for these two valence extremes obscures their unique content. This functional architecture, whereby subjective valence maps onto a pattern continuum between pleasant and unpleasant poles, offers a robust mechanism by which context, expectation, and experience could alter the set-point for valence-based behavior. Finally, identification of spatial and temporal differentiation of valence in amygdala may shed new insights into individual differences in emotional responding, with potential relevance for affective disorders.},

The concept of a cognitive map has emerged as one of the leading metaphors for these capacities, and unraveling the learning and neural representation of such a map has become a central focus of neuroscience. In recent years, many models have been developed to explain cellular responses in the hippocampus and other brain areas. Because it can be difficult to see how these models differ, how they relate and what each model can contribute, this Review aims to organize these models into a clear ontology. This ontology reveals parallels between existing empirical results, and implies new approaches to understand hippocampal-cortical interactions and beyond.},

	abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is used clinically for the treatment of depression however outcomes vary greatly between patients. We have shown that average clinical efficacy of different left DLPFC TMS sites is related to intrinsic functional connectivity with remote regions including the subgenual cingulate and suggested that functional connectivity with these remote regions might be used to identify optimized left DLPFC targets for TMS. However it remains unclear if and how this connectivity-based targeting approach should be applied at the single-subject level to potentially individualize therapy to specific patients. In this article we show that individual differences in DLPFC connectivity are large, reproducible across sessions, and can be used to generate individualized DLPFC TMS targets that may prove clinically superior to those selected on the basis of group-average connectivity. Factors likely to improve individualized targeting including the use of seed maps and the focality of stimulation are investigated and discussed. The techniques presented here may be applicable to individualized targeting of focal brain stimulation across a range of diseases and stimulation modalities and can be experimentally tested in clinical trials.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {How and to what extent electrical brain activity reflects pharmacologically altered states and contents of consciousness, is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated whether measures of evoked and spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity are altered by sub-anaesthetic levels of ketamine compared to normal wakefulness, and how these measures relate to subjective experience. High-density 62-channel EEG was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and during administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from EEG responses to TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). Although no significant difference was found in TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity (LZc, ACE, SCE) showed significantly increased values in the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in signal diversity correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine. The results suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may reflect distinct, complementary aspects of changes in brain properties related to altered states of consciousness: the brain's capacity for information integration, assessed by PCI, might be indicative of the brain's ability to sustain consciousness, while spontaneous complexity, as measured by EEG signal diversity, may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content. Thus, sub-anaesthetic ketamine may increase the complexity of the conscious content and the brain activity underlying it, while the level or general capacity for consciousness remains largely unaffected.},

	volume = {28},
	abstract = {Psilocybin therapy shows antidepressant potential, but its therapeutic actions are not well understood. We assessed the subacute impact of psilocybin on brain function in two clinical trials of depression. The first was an open-label trial of orally administered psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 d apart) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded at baseline and 1 d after the 25-mg dose. Beck's depression inventory was the primary outcome measure ( MR/J00460X/1 ). The second trial was a double-blind phase II randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin therapy with escitalopram. Patients with major depressive disorder received either 2 × 25 mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily placebo ('psilocybin arm') or 2 × 1 mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily escitalopram (10-20 mg) ('escitalopram arm'). fMRI was recorded at baseline and 3 weeks after the second psilocybin dose ( NCT03429075 ). In both trials, the antidepressant response to psilocybin was rapid, sustained and correlated with decreases in fMRI brain network modularity, implying that psilocybin's antidepressant action may depend on a global increase in brain network integration. Network cartography analyses indicated that 5-HT2A receptor-rich higher-order functional networks became more functionally interconnected and flexible after psilocybin treatment. The antidepressant response to escitalopram was milder and no changes in brain network organization were observed. Consistent efficacy-related brain changes, correlating with robust antidepressant effects across two studies, suggest an antidepressant mechanism for psilocybin therapy: global increases in brain network integration.},

	abstract = {The apparent dichotomy between information-processing and dynamical approaches to complexity science forces researchers to choose between two diverging sets of tools and explanations, creating conflict and often hindering scientific progress. Nonetheless, given the shared theoretical goals between both approaches, it is reasonable to conjecture the existence of underlying common signatures that capture interesting behavior in both dynamical and information-processing systems. Here, we argue that a pragmatic use of integrated information theory (IIT), originally conceived in theoretical neuroscience, can provide a potential unifying framework to study complexity in general multivariate systems. By leveraging metrics put forward by the integrated information decomposition framework, our results reveal that integrated information can effectively capture surprisingly heterogeneous signatures of complexity-including metastability and criticality in networks of coupled oscillators as well as distributed computation and emergent stable particles in cellular automata-without relying on idiosyncratic, ad hoc criteria. These results show how an agnostic use of IIT can provide important steps toward bridging the gap between informational and dynamical approaches to complex systems.},

In this work, we introduce and study an RNN-based variational autoencoder generative model that incorporates distributed latent representations of entire sentences. This factorization allows it to explicitly model holistic properties of sentences such as style, topic, and high-level syntactic features. Samples from the prior over these sentence representations remarkably produce diverse and well-formed sentences through simple deterministic decoding. By examining paths through this latent space, we are able to generate coherent novel sentences that interpolate between known sentences. We present techniques for solving the difficult learning problem presented by this model, demonstrate its effectiveness in imputing missing words, explore many interesting properties of the model's latent sentence space, and present negative results on the use of the model in language modeling.},

Newell and co-workers were the first to show the utility of a GW or “blackboard” architecture in a distributed set of knowledge sources, which could cooperatively solve problems that no single constituent could solve alone. The empirical connection with conscious cognition was made by Baars (1988, 2002). GW theory generates explicit predictions for conscious aspects of perception, emotion, motivation, learning, working memory, voluntary control, and self systems in the brain. It has similarities to biological theories such as Neural Darwinism and dynamical theories of brain functioning. Functional brain imaging now shows that conscious cognition is distinctively associated with wide spread of cortical activity, notably toward frontoparietal and medial temporal regions. Unconscious comparison conditions tend to activate only local regions, such as visual projection areas. Frontoparietal hypometabolism is also implicated in unconscious states, including deep sleep, coma, vegetative states, epileptic loss of consciousness, and general anesthesia. These findings are consistent with the GW hypothesis, which is now favored by a number of scientists and philosophers.},

However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and predictive cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes the experienced transition structure. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial map and a weakening of the predictive map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the degree to which an outcome is consistent with the spatial rather than the predictive map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.},

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) works faster and better than conventional pharmacological interventions; however, those benefits come with a burden of side effects, most notably memory loss. Disentangling the mechanisms by which ECT exerts rapid therapeutic benefit from the mechanisms driving adverse effects could enable the development of the next generation of seizure therapies that lack the downside of ECT. The latest research suggests that this goal may be attainable because modifications of ECT technique have already yielded improvements in cognitive outcomes without sacrificing efficacy. These modifications involve changes in how the electricity is administered (both where in the brain, and how much), which in turn impacts the characteristics of the resulting seizure. What we do not completely understand is whether it is the changes in the applied electricity, or in the resulting seizure, or both, that are responsible for improved safety. Answering this question may be key to developing the next generation of seizure therapies that lack these adverse side effects, and ushering in novel interventions that are better, faster, and safer than ECT.},

	title = {Is my “red” your “red”?: {Unsupervised} alignment of qualia structures via optimal transport},
	abstract = {To what extent are sensory experiences equivalent between individuals? One promising approach to this fundamental question about consciousness is to intersubjectively compare the similarity relationships of sensory experiences, named “qualia structures”. Conventional methods for comparing the similarity relationships largely sidestep the issue by assuming experiences evoked by the same stimuli are matched across individuals, precluding the possibility that my “red” might be your “blue”. Here, we present an unsupervised optimal transport method for assessing the similarity of qualia structures without assuming correspondence between individuals. As proof of concept, we analyzed two massive datasets: dissimilarity judgments for 93 colors and 1854 natural objects. In both cases, we found that qualia structures can be “correctly” aligned across participants based solely on similarity relationships, providing quantitative evidence for the structural equivalence of qualia of color and natural objects across individuals. This method is applicable to any modality of experience, enabling general structural exploration of subjective experiences.},

	volume = {71},
	abstract = {Rewards are both “liked” and “wanted,” and those 2 words seem almost interchangeable. However, the brain circuitry that mediates the psychological process of “wanting” a particular reward is dissociable from circuitry that mediates the degree to which it is “liked.” Incentive salience or “wanting,” a form of motivation, is generated by large and robust neural systems that include mesolimbic dopamine. By comparison, “liking,” or the actual pleasurable impact of reward consumption, is mediated by smaller and fragile neural systems, and is not dependent on dopamine. The incentive-sensitization theory posits the essence of drug addiction to be excessive amplification specifically of psychological “wanting,” especially triggered by cues, without necessarily an amplification of “liking.” This is because of long-lasting changes in dopamine-related motivation systems of susceptible individuals, called “neural sensitization.” A quarter-century after its proposal, evidence has continued to grow in support the incentive-sensitization theory. Further, its scope is now expanding to include diverse behavioral addictions and other psychopathologies. (PsycINFO Database Record},

	title = {{LSD}-induced increase of {Ising} temperature and algorithmic complexity of brain dynamics},
	volume = {19},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {A topic of growing interest in computational neuroscience is the discovery of fundamental principles underlying global dynamics and the self-organization of the brain. In particular, the notion that the brain operates near criticality has gained considerable support, and recent work has shown that the dynamics of different brain states may be modeled by pairwise maximum entropy Ising models at various distances from a phase transition, i.e., from criticality. Here we aim to characterize two brain states (psychedelics-induced and placebo) as captured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with features derived from the Ising spin model formalism (system temperature, critical point, susceptibility) and from algorithmic complexity. We hypothesized, along the lines of the entropic brain hypothesis, that psychedelics drive brain dynamics into a more disordered state at a higher Ising temperature and increased complexity. We analyze resting state blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI data collected in an earlier study from fifteen subjects in a control condition (placebo) and during ingestion of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Working with the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) brain parcellation, we first create “archetype” Ising models representative of the entire dataset (global) and of the data in each condition. Remarkably, we find that such archetypes exhibit a strong correlation with an average structural connectome template obtained from dMRI (r = 0.6). We compare the archetypes from the two conditions and find that the Ising connectivity in the LSD condition is lower than in the placebo one, especially in homotopic links (interhemispheric connectivity), reflecting a significant decrease of homotopic functional connectivity in the LSD condition. The global archetype is then personalized for each individual and condition by adjusting the system temperature. The resulting temperatures are all near but above the critical point of the model in the paramagnetic (disordered) phase. The individualized Ising temperatures are higher in the LSD condition than in the placebo condition (p = 9 × 10-5). Next, we estimate the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) complexity of the binarized BOLD data and the synthetic data generated with the individualized model using the Metropolis algorithm for each participant and condition. The LZW complexity computed from experimental data reveals a weak statistical relationship with condition (p = 0.04 one-tailed Wilcoxon test) and none with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.13, p = 0.65), presumably because of the limited length of the BOLD time series. Similarly, we explore complexity using the block decomposition method (BDM), a more advanced method for estimating algorithmic complexity. The BDM complexity of the experimental data displays a significant correlation with Ising temperature (r(13) = 0.56, p = 0.03) and a weak but significant correlation with condition (p = 0.04, one-tailed Wilcoxon test). This study suggests that the effects of LSD increase the complexity of brain dynamics by loosening interhemispheric connectivity-especially homotopic links. In agreement with earlier work using the Ising formalism with BOLD data, we find the brain state in the placebo condition is already above the critical point, with LSD resulting in a shift further away from criticality into a more disordered state.},

We make this case by relating an existing cognitive model of category learning to a learning circuit involving the hippocampus, perirhinal, and prefrontal cortices. Results from groups varying in function along this circuit (e.g., infants, amnesics, and older adults) are successfully simulated by reducing the model's ability to form new clusters in response to surprising events, such as an error in supervised learning or an unfamiliar stimulus in unsupervised learning. Clusters in the model are akin to conjunctive codes that are rooted in an episodic experience (the surprising event) yet can develop to resemble abstract codes as they are updated by subsequent experiences. Thus, the model holds that the line separating episodic and semantic information can become blurred.

These neuroscientific theories stem from the perspectives of physics, engineering, mathematics, and psychology and create a complicated landscape of domain-specific terminology and meaning, which, when used outside of that domain, may lead to incorrect assumptions and conclusions within the neuroscience community. Here we review and clarify the key concepts of Connectivity, Computation, Criticality, and Coherence — the 4C's — and outline a potential role for metastability as a common denominator across these propositions. We analyze and synthesize whole-brain neuroimaging research, examined through functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), to demonstrate that complexity science offers a principled and integrated approach to describe, and potentially understand, macroscale spontaneous brain functioning.},

	volume = {91},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite tremendous advances in characterizing human neural circuits that govern emotional and cognitive functions impaired in depression and anxiety, we lack a circuit-based taxonomy for depression and anxiety that captures transdiagnostic heterogeneity and informs clinical decision making. METHODS: We developed and tested a novel system for quantifying 6 brain circuits reproducibly and at the individual patient level. We implemented standardized circuit definitions relative to a healthy reference sample and algorithms to generate circuit clinical scores for the overall circuit and its constituent regions. RESULTS: In new data from primary and generalizability samples of depression and anxiety (N = 250), we demonstrated that overall disconnections within task-free salience and default mode circuits map onto symptoms of anxious avoidance, loss of pleasure, threat dysregulation, and negative emotional biases-core characteristics that transcend diagnoses-and poorer daily function. Regional dysfunctions within task-evoked cognitive control and affective circuits may implicate symptoms of cognitive and valence-congruent emotional functions. Circuit dysfunction scores also distinguished response to antidepressant and behavioral intervention treatments in an independent sample (n = 205). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings articulate circuit dimensions that relate to transdiagnostic symptoms across mood and anxiety disorders. Our novel system offers a foundation for deploying standardized circuit assessments across research groups, trials, and clinics to advance more precise classifications and treatment targets for psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Many neuroimaging studies have investigated reward processing dysfunction in major depressive disorder. These studies have led to the common idea that major depressive disorder is associated with blunted responses within the reward circuit, particularly in the ventral striatum. Yet, the link between major depressive disorder and reward-related responses in other regions remains inconclusive, thus limiting our understanding of the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. To address this issue, we performed a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 41 whole-brain neuroimaging studies encompassing reward-related responses from a total of 794 patients with major depressive disorder and 803 healthy controls. Our findings argue against the common idea that major depressive disorder is primarily linked to deficits within the reward system. Instead, our results demonstrate that major depressive disorder is associated with opposing abnormalities in the reward circuit: hypo-responses in the ventral striatum and hyper-responses in the orbitofrontal cortex. The current findings suggest that dysregulated corticostriatal connectivity may underlie reward-processing abnormalities in major depressive disorder, providing an empirical foundation for a more refined understanding of abnormalities in the reward circuitry in major depressive disorder.},

These models included disease-specific atrophy maps as priors to modulate local parameters, revealing increased stability of hippocampal and insular dynamics as signatures of brain atrophy in AD and bvFTD, respectively. Using variational autoencoders, we visualized different pathologies and their severity as the evolution of trajectories in a low-dimensional latent space. Finally, we perturbed the model to reveal key AD- and bvFTD-specific regions to induce transitions from pathological to healthy brain states. Overall, we obtained novel insights on disease progression and control by means of external stimulation, while identifying dynamical mechanisms that underlie functional alterations in neurodegeneration.},

Based on behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs), the present study investigates the brain's ability to encode abstract auditory rules with a dynamic approach in which rules constantly emerge and vanish. In successive conditions, abstract rules are task-irrelevant and task-relevant. Results show that as few as two consecutive exemplars of an abstract feature (frequency relation between successive tones) are sufficient for rule extraction. The extraction of just emerging rules is independent of the amount of attention devoted to the rules, and it is not modulated by further rule-conforming exemplars. The extracted rules are immediately applied, as evidenced by the interference of task-irrelevant rule violations with concurrent mental processes (distraction condition) and by the conscious detection of task-relevant violations (detection condition). The ability to rapidly encode abstract rules and to detect presumably important rule-violating events underlines the brain's adaptability to the environmental demands.},

The MMN can be elicited by many kinds of stimulus change, varying from simple changes in a single stimulus feature to abstract changes in the relationship between stimuli. The main intracerebral sources for the MMN are located in the auditory cortices of the temporal lobe. Since it occurs whether or not stim- uli are being attended, the MMN represents an automatic cerebral process for detecting change. The MMN is clini- cally helpful in terms of demonstrating disordered sen- sory processing or disordered memory in groups of patients. Improvements in the techniques for measuring the MMN and in the paradigms for eliciting it will be needed before the MMN can become clinically useful as an objective measurement of such disorders in individu- al patients.},

	volume = {31},
	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a grand challenge to human health and society, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive. Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that MDD is associated with abnormal interactions and dynamics in two major neural systems including the default mode - salience (DMN-SAL) network and the executive - limbic (EXE-LIM) network, but it is not clear which network plays a central role and which network plays a subordinate role in MDD pathophysiology. To address this question, we refined a newly developed Multiscale Neural Model Inversion (MNMI) framework and applied it to test whether MDD is more affected by impaired circuit interactions in the DMN-SAL network or the EXE-LIM network. The model estimates the directed connection strengths between different neural populations both within and between brain regions based on resting-state fMRI data collected from normal healthy subjects and patients with MDD. Results show that MDD is primarily characterized by abnormal circuit interactions in the EXE-LIM network rather than the DMN-SAL network. Specifically, we observe reduced frontoparietal effective connectivity that potentially contributes to hypoactivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and decreased intrinsic inhibition combined with increased excitation from the superior parietal cortex (SPC) that potentially lead to amygdala hyperactivity, together resulting in activation imbalance in the PFC-amygdala circuit that pervades in MDD. Moreover, the model reveals reduced PFC-to-hippocampus excitation but decreased SPC-to-thalamus inhibition in MDD population that potentially lead to hypoactivity in the hippocampus and hyperactivity in the thalamus, consistent with previous experimental data. Overall, our findings provide strong support for the long-standing limbic-cortical dysregulation model in major depression but also offer novel insights into the multiscale pathophysiology of this debilitating disease.},

Accordingly, its management is still poor. Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative stress, measured on various matrices such as serum, plasma or erythrocytes, has a critical role in MDD. The aim of this narrative review is to identify serum, plasma and erythrocyte biomarkers of oxidative stress in MDD patients according to disease stage and clinical features. Sixty-three articles referenced on PubMed and Embase between 1 January 1991, and 31 December 2022, were included. Modifications to antioxidant enzymes (mainly glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) in MDD were highlighted. Non-enzymatic antioxidants (mainly uric acid) were decreased in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. These changes were associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species. Therefore, increased oxidative damage products (principally malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl content and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine) were present in MDD patients. Specific modifications could be identified according to disease stages and clinical features. Interestingly, antidepressant treatment corrected these changes. Accordingly, in patients in remission from depression, oxidative stress markers were globally normalized. This narrative review suggests the particular interest of oxidative stress biomarkers for MDD care that may contribute to the heterogeneity of the disease and provide the opportunity to find new therapeutic targets.},

Whilst elevated activity within area 25 of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC/25) has been implicated in these illnesses, it is unknown whether this over-activity is causal. By combining targeted intracerebral microinfusions with cardiovascular and behavioral monitoring in marmosets, we show that over-activation of sgACC/25 reduces vagal tone and heart rate variability, alters cortisol dynamics during stress and heightens reactivity to proximal and distal threat. 18F-FDG PET imaging shows these changes are accompanied by altered activity within a network of brain regions including the amygdala, hypothalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Ketamine, shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, fails to reverse elevated arousal to distal threat contrary to the beneficial effects we have previously demonstrated on over-activation induced reward blunting, illustrating the symptom-specificity of its actions.},

Here we introduce a new neural network formalization of systems consolidation that reveals an overlooked tension—unregulated neocortical memory transfer can cause overfitting and harm generalization in an unpredictable world. We resolve this tension by postulating that memories only consolidate when it aids generalization. This framework accounts for partial hippocampal–cortical memory transfer and provides a normative principle for reconceptualizing numerous observations in the field. Generalization-optimized systems consolidation thus provides new insight into how adaptive behavior benefits from complementary learning systems specialized for memorization and generalization.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. In particular, it is linked to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Histopathological hallmarks of AD are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular formation of senile plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) in aggregated form along with metal-ions such as copper, iron or zinc. Redox active metal ions, as for example copper, can catalyze the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) when bound to the amyloid-β (Aβ). The ROS thus produced, in particular the hydroxyl radical which is the most reactive one, may contribute to oxidative damage on both the Aβ peptide itself and on surrounding molecule (proteins, lipids, …). This review highlights the existing link between oxidative stress and AD, and the consequences towards the Aβ peptide and surrounding molecules in terms of oxidative damage. In addition, the implication of metal ions in AD, their interaction with the Aβ peptide and redox properties leading to ROS production are discussed, along with both in vitro and in vivo oxidation of the Aβ peptide, at the molecular level.},

Indeed, relapse, recurrency, and therapeutic resistance are serious challenges in the fight against depression. Nevertheless, abnormal functioning of the stress response, inflammatory processes, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity are known to underlie the pathophysiology of this mental disorder. The role of oxidative stress in disease and, particularly, in depression is widely recognized, being important for both its onset and development. Indeed, excessive generation of reactive oxygen species and lack of efficient antioxidant response trigger processes such as inflammation, neurodegeneration, and neuronal death. Keeping in mind the importance of a detailed study about cellular and molecular mechanisms that are present in depression, this review focuses on the link between oxidative stress and the stress response, neuroinflammation, serotonergic pathways, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity's imbalances present in depression. The study of these mechanisms is important to lead to a new era of treatment and knowledge about this highly complex disease.},

In affective disorders, anhedonia (lack of pleasure) or dysphoria (negative affect) can result from breakdowns of that hedonic system. Human neuroimaging studies indicate that surprisingly similar circuitry is activated by quite diverse pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency shared by all. Wanting for reward is generated by a large and distributed brain system. Liking, or pleasure itself, is generated by a smaller set of hedonic hot spots within limbic circuitry. Those hot spots also can be embedded in broader anatomical patterns of valence organization, such as in a keyboard pattern of nucleus accumbens generators for desire versus dread. In contrast, some of the best known textbook candidates for pleasure generators, including classic pleasure electrodes and the mesolimbic dopamine system, may not generate pleasure after all. These emerging insights into brain pleasure mechanisms may eventually facilitate better treatments for affective disorders.},

As a result, these advances have not been translated into actionable clinical tools, and the language of brain circuits has not been incorporated into training programmes. To address this gap, I present this synthesis of published work, with a focus on functional imaging of circuit dysfunctions across the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders. This synthesis provides the foundation for a taxonomy of putative types of dysfunction, which cuts across traditional diagnostic boundaries for depression and anxiety and includes instead distinct types of neural circuit dysfunction that together reflect the heterogeneity of depression and anxiety. This taxonomy is suited to specifying symptoms in terms of underlying neural dysfunction at the individual level and is intended as the foundation for building mechanistic research and ultimately guiding clinical practice.},

Although functional and structural PFC abnormalities have been reported in both individuals with current MDD as well as those at increased vulnerability to MDD, this information has not translated into better treatment and prevention strategies. Here, we argue that dissecting depressive phenotypes into biologically more tractable dimensions - negative processing biases, anhedonia, despair-like behavior (learned helplessness) - affords unique opportunities for integrating clinical findings with mechanistic evidence emerging from preclinical models relevant to depression, and thereby promises to improve our understanding of MDD. To this end, we review and integrate clinical and preclinical literature pertinent to these core phenotypes, while emphasizing a systems-level approach, treatment effects, and whether specific PFC abnormalities are causes or consequences of MDD. In addition, we discuss several key issues linked to cross-species translation, including functional brain homology across species, the importance of dissecting neural pathways underlying specific functional domains that can be fruitfully probed across species, and the experimental approaches that best ensure translatability. Future directions and clinical implications of this burgeoning literature are discussed.},

	volume = {73},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticolimbic circuits, including direct projections from prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens (NAc), permit top-down control of intense motivations generated by subcortical circuits. In rats, localized disruptions of glutamate signaling within medial shell of NAc generate desire or dread, anatomically organized along a rostrocaudal gradient analogous to a limbic keyboard. At rostral locations in shell, these disruptions generate appetitive eating, but at caudal locations the disruptions generate progressively fearful behaviors (distress vocalizations, escape attempts, and antipredator reactions). Here, we asked whether medial prefrontal cortex can modulate intense motivations generated by subcortical NAc disruptions. METHODS: We used simultaneous microinjections in medial prefrontal cortex regions and in NAc shell to examine whether the desire or dread generated by NAc shell disruptions is modulated by activation/inhibition of three specific regions of prefrontal cortex: medial orbitofrontal cortex, infralimbic cortex (homologous to area 25 or subgenual anterior cingulate in the human), or prelimbic cortex (midventral anterior cingulate). RESULTS: We found that activation of medial orbitofrontal cortex biased intense bivalent motivation in an appetitive direction by amplifying generation of eating behavior by middle to caudal NAc disruptions, without altering fear. In contrast, activation of infralimbic prefrontal cortex powerfully and generally suppressed both appetitive eating and fearful behaviors generated by NAc shell disruptions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that corticolimbic projections from discrete prefrontal regions can either bias motivational valence or generally suppress subcortically generated intense motivations of desire or fear.},

	volume = {628},
	abstract = {Consciousness is thought to scale with brain complexity, and it may be diminished in anesthesia. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) of field potentials has been shown to be a promising measure of the level of consciousness in anesthetized human subjects, neurological patients, and across the sleep-wake states in rats. Whether this relationship holds for intrinsic networks obtained by functional brain imaging has not been tested. To fill this gap of knowledge, we estimated LZC from large-scale dynamic analysis of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) in conscious sedated and unconscious anesthetized rats. Blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) signals were obtained from 30-min whole-brain resting-state scans while the anesthetic propofol was infused intravenously at constant infusion rates of 20 mg/kg/h (conscious sedated) and 40 mg/kg/h (unconscious). Dynamic brain networks were defined at voxel level by sliding window analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the BOLD signal. From scans performed at low to high propofol dose, the LZC was significantly reduced by 110\%. The results suggest that the difference in LZC between conscious sedated and anesthetized unconscious subjects is conserved in rats and this effect is detectable in large-scale brain network obtained from fMRI.},

	title = {{REBUS} and the anarchic brain: {Toward} a unified model of the brain action of psychedelics},
	volume = {71},
	abstract = {This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that-via their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity-psychedelics work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical perspectives. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelics are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of global brain function, hierarchical predictive coding, with an often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, the entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched pathological priors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lesion and neuroimaging studies suggest that left prefrontal lobe dysfunction is pathophysiologically linked to depression. Rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to prefrontal structures has a lateralised effect on mood in normal volunteers, and several preliminary studies suggest a beneficial effect of rTMS on depression. However, adequately controlled studies have not been conducted. METHODS: We have studied the effects of focal rTMS on the depressive symptoms in 17 patients with medication-resistant depression of psychotic subtype. The study was designed as a multiple cross-over, randomised placebo-controlled trial. Sham rTMS and stimulation of different cortical areas were used as controls. FINDINGS: Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex rTMS resulted in a significant decrease in scores on the Hamilton depression rating scale HDRS (from 25.2 to 13.8) and the self-rated Beck questionnaire BQ (from 47.9 to 25.7). 11 of the 17 patients showed pronounced improvement that lasted for about 2 weeks after 5 days of daily rTMS sessions. No patient experienced any significant undesirable side-effects. INTERPRETATION: Our findings emphasise the role of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression, and suggest that rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex might become a safe, non-convulsive alternative to electroconvulsive treatment in depression.},

	abstract = {Several decades of research suggest that weak electric fields may influence neural processing, including those induced by neuronal activity and proposed as a substrate for a potential new cellular communication system, i.e., ephaptic transmission. Here we aim to model mesoscopic ephaptic activity in the human brain and explore its trajectory during aging by characterizing the electric field generated by cortical dipoles using realistic finite element modeling. Extrapolating from electrophysiological measurements, we first observe that modeled endogenous field magnitudes are comparable to those in measurements of weak but functionally relevant self-generated fields and to those produced by noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation, and therefore possibly able to modulate neuronal activity. Then, to evaluate the role of these fields in the human cortex in large MRI databases, we adapt an interaction approximation that considers the relative orientation of neuron and field to estimate the membrane potential perturbation in pyramidal cells. We use this approximation to define a simplified metric (EMOD1) that weights dipole coupling as a function of distance and relative orientation between emitter and receiver and evaluate it in a sample of 401 realistic human brain models from healthy subjects aged 16-83. Results reveal that ephaptic coupling, in the simplified mesoscopic modeling approach used here, significantly decreases with age, with higher involvement of sensorimotor regions and medial brain structures. This study suggests that by providing the means for fast and direct interaction between neurons, ephaptic modulation may contribute to the complexity of human function for cognition and behavior, and its modification across the lifespan and in response to pathology.},

We train a “graph neural network” to simulate the dynamics of our solar system's Sun, planets, and large moons from 30 years of trajectory data. We then use symbolic regression to discover an analytical expression for the force law implicitly learned by the neural network, which our results showed is equivalent to Newton's law of gravitation. The key assumptions that were required were translational and rotational equivariance, and Newton's second and third laws of motion. Our approach correctly discovered the form of the symbolic force law. Furthermore, our approach did not require any assumptions about the masses of planets and moons or physical constants. They, too, were accurately inferred through our methods. Though, of course, the classical law of gravitation has been known since Isaac Newton, our result serves as a validation that our method can discover unknown laws and hidden properties from observed data. More broadly this work represents a key step toward realizing the potential of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery.},

	volume = {26},
	abstract = {Psychedelics produce fast and persistent antidepressant effects and induce neuroplasticity resembling the effects of clinically approved antidepressants. We recently reported that pharmacologically diverse antidepressants, including fluoxetine and ketamine, act by binding to TrkB, the receptor for BDNF. Here we show that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocin directly bind to TrkB with affinities 1,000-fold higher than those for other antidepressants, and that psychedelics and antidepressants bind to distinct but partially overlapping sites within the transmembrane domain of TrkB dimers. The effects of psychedelics on neurotrophic signaling, plasticity and antidepressant-like behavior in mice depend on TrkB binding and promotion of endogenous BDNF signaling but are independent of serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) activation, whereas LSD-induced head twitching is dependent on 5-HT2A and independent of TrkB binding. Our data confirm TrkB as a common primary target for antidepressants and suggest that high-affinity TrkB positive allosteric modulators lacking 5-HT2A activity may retain the antidepressant potential of psychedelics without hallucinogenic effects.},

Here we investigated whether replay coincided with spontaneous patterns of whole-brain activity. We found, in two separate datasets, that replay sequences were packaged into transient bursts occurring selectively during activation of the default mode network (DMN) and parietal alpha networks. These networks are believed to support inwardly oriented attention and inhibit bottom-up sensory processing and were characterized by widespread synchronized oscillations coupled to increases in high frequency power, mechanisms thought to coordinate information flow between disparate cortical areas. Our data reveal a tight correspondence between two widely studied phenomena in neural physiology and suggest that the DMN may coordinate replay bursts in a manner that minimizes interference with ongoing cognition.},

	title = {Seeking a unified framework for cerebellar function and dysfunction: from circuit operations to cognition},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Following the fundamental recognition of its involvement in sensory-motor coordination and learning, the cerebellum is now also believed to take part in the processing of cognition and emotion. This hypothesis is recurrent in numerous papers reporting anatomical and functional observations, and it requires an explanation. We argue that a similar circuit structure in all cerebellar areas may carry out various operations using a common computational scheme. On the basis of a broad review of anatomical data, it is conceivable that the different roles of the cerebellum lie in the specific connectivity of the cerebellar modules, with motor, cognitive, and emotional functions (at least partially) segregated into different cerebro-cerebellar loops. We here develop a conceptual and operational framework based on multiple interconnected levels (a meta-levels hypothesis): from cellular/molecular to network mechanisms leading to generation of computational primitives, thence to high-level cognitive/emotional processing, and finally to the sphere of mental function and dysfunction. The main concept explored is that of intimate interplay between timing and learning (reminiscent of the “timing and learning machine” capabilities long attributed to the cerebellum), which reverberates from cellular to circuit mechanisms. Subsequently, integration within large-scale brain loops could generate the disparate cognitive/emotional and mental functions in which the cerebellum has been implicated. We propose, therefore, that the cerebellum operates as a general-purpose co-processor, whose effects depend on the specific brain centers to which individual modules are connected. Abnormal functioning in these loops could eventually contribute to the pathogenesis of major brain pathologies including not just ataxia but also dyslexia, autism, schizophrenia, and depression.},

Here, using the recently developed AAV1-mediated anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique in mice, we show that NAc neurons receiving basolateral amygdala inputs (NAcBLA) promote positive reinforcement via disinhibiting dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In contrast, NAc neurons receiving paraventricular thalamic inputs (NAcPVT) innervate GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and mediate aversion. Silencing the synaptic output of NAcBLA neurons impairs reward seeking behavior, while silencing of NAcPVT or NAcPVT→LH pathway abolishes aversive symptoms of opiate withdrawal. Our results elucidate the afferent-specific circuit architecture of the NAc in controlling reward and aversion.},

To determine whether the functional organization of neural networks underlying these domains predict subsequent relapse, we generated theoretically defined addiction networks. We collected resting functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 45 individuals with AUD during early abstinence (number of days abstinent M = 25.40, SD = 16.51) and calculated the degree of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within these networks. Regression analyses determined whether the RSFC strength in domain-defined addiction networks measured during early abstinence predicted subsequent relapse (dichotomous or continuous relapse metrics). RSFC within each addiction network measured during early abstinence was significantly lower in those that relapsed (vs. abstained) and predicted subsequent time to relapse. Lower incentive salience RSFC during early abstinence increased the odds of relapsing. Neither RSFC in a control network nor clinical self-report measures predicted relapse. The association between low incentive salience RSFC and faster relapse highlights the need to design timely interventions that enhance RSFC in AUD individuals at risk of relapsing faster.},

The brain is more vulnerable to oxidative stress (OS) because of its higher oxygen consumption, higher lipid content, and weaker antioxidative defence. OS is a main cause of neurodegeneration and its involvement in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is unequivocally established.

	abstract = {Abstract. The human sequential grouping that organizes parts of tones into a group was examined by the mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of event-related poten- tials that reveals the sensory memory process. The sequen- tial grouping is accomplished by the combinations of some factors, e.g., temporal and frequency proximity principles. In this study, auditory oddball stimuli in which each of the stimuli consisted of series of tone bursts, were applied to the subjects, and the MMN elicited by the deviation of the frequency of the last tone in the stimulus was investi- gated. The relationship between the expected phenomena of sequential grouping of tones and observed magnitudes of MMN was evaluated. It was shown that the magnitudes of MMN changed according to the configuration (num- ber of tones, frequency) of tone sequence to be stored. This result suggested that the sequential grouping of pre- sented tones was achieved on the preattentive auditory sensory memory process. It was also shown that the rel- ative change of MMN magnitudes corresponded to the conditions of sequential grouping, which had been pro- posed by the auditory psychophysical studies. The inves- tigation of MMN properties could reveal the nature of auditory sequential grouping.},

	title = {Serotonergic regulation of neuronal excitability in the prefrontal cortex},
	volume = {61},
	abstract = {The cerebral cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation originating predominantly from the dorsal raphe nucleus. This innervation regulates cortical functioning by activating multiple serotonin receptors that are differentially expressed by pyramidal cells and interneurons. Electrophysiological studies in the prefrontal cortex indicate that receptors of the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) subtypes are the main serotonin receptors regulating membrane excitability in pyramidal cells. Most pyramidal cells in layer V coexpress 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors that together regulate how these neurons encode excitatory input into neuronal firing. In contrast, a subset of large pyramidal cells of deep layer V appears to express exclusively 5-HT(2A) receptors that depolarize and excite these cells. Serotonin also depolarizes and excites at least two classes of GABAergic interneurons by acting on 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. The differential expression of serotonin receptors in different pyramidal cells and interneurons is consistent with a growing appreciation of the anatomical, molecular and functional heterogeneity of pyramidal cells and interneurons of the cerebral cortex. These findings begin to lay the ground for a cellular-level understanding of the serotonergic regulation of the prefrontal cortex.},

@article{nitscheSerotoninAffectsTranscranial2009,
	title = {Serotonin affects transcranial direct current-induced neuroplasticity in humans},
	volume = {66},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modulation of the serotonergic system affects long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), the likely neurophysiologic derivates of learning and memory formation, in animals and slice preparations. Serotonin-dependent modulation of plasticity has been proposed as an underlying mechanism for depression. However, direct knowledge about the impact of serotonin on neuroplasticity in humans is missing. Here we explore the impact of the serotonin reuptake blocker citalopram on plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans in a single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study. METHODS: In 12 healthy subjects, anodal excitability-enhancing or cathodal excitability-diminishing tDCS was applied to the motor cortex under a single dose of 20-mg citalopram or placebo medication. Motor cortex excitability was monitored by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). RESULTS: Under placebo medication, anodal tDCS enhanced, and cathodal tDCS reduced, excitability for about 60-120 min. Citalopram enhanced and prolonged the facilitation induced by anodal tDCS, whereas it turned cathodal tDCS-induced inhibition into facilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonin has a prominent impact on neuroplasticity in humans, which is in favor for facilitatory plasticity. Taking into account serotonergic hypoactivity in depression, this might explain deficits of learning and memory formation. Moreover, the results suggest that for therapeutic brain stimulation in depression and other neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., in neurorehabilitation), serotonergic reinforcement may enhance facilitatory aftereffects and thereby increase the efficacy of these tools.},

	abstract = {Self-organized criticality (SOC) refers to the ability of complex systems to evolve toward a second-order phase transition at which interactions between system components lead to scale-invariant events that are beneficial for system performance. For the last two decades, considerable experimental evidence has accumulated that the mammalian cortex with its diversity in cell types, interconnectivity, and plasticity might exhibit SOC. Here, we review the experimental findings of isolated, layered cortex preparations to self-organize toward four dynamical motifs presently identified in the intact cortex in vivo: up-states, oscillations, neuronal avalanches, and coherence potentials. During up-states, the synchronization observed for nested theta/gamma oscillations embeds scale-invariant neuronal avalanches, which can be identified by robust power law scaling in avalanche sizes with a slope of −3/2 and a critical branching parameter of 1. This precise dynamical coordination, tracked in the negative transients of the local field potential (nLFP) and spiking activity of pyramidal neurons using two-photon imaging, emerges autonomously in superficial layers of organotypic cortex cultures and acute cortex slices, is homeostatically regulated, exhibits separation of time scales, and reveals unique size vs. quiet time dependencies. A subclass of avalanches, the coherence potentials, exhibits precise maintenance of the time course in propagated local synchrony. Avalanches emerge in superficial layers of the cortex under conditions of strong external drive. The balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I), as well as neuromodulators such as dopamine, establishes powerful control parameters for avalanche dynamics. This rich dynamical repertoire is not observed in dissociated cortex cultures, which lack the differentiation into cortical layers and exhibit a dynamical phenotype expected for a first-order phase transition. The precise interactions between up-states, nested oscillations, and avalanches in superficial layers of the cortex provide compelling evidence for SOC in the brain.},

Theoretical and experimental studies show that critical systems often exhibit optimal computational properties, suggesting the possibility that criticality has been evolutionarily selected as a useful trait for our nervous system. Evidence for criticality has been found in cell cultures, brain slices, and anesthetized animals. Yet, inconsistent results were reported for recordings in awake animals and humans, and current results point to open questions about the exact nature and mechanism of criticality, as well as its functional role. Therefore, the criticality hypothesis has remained a controversial proposition. Here, we provide an account of the mathematical and physical foundations of criticality. In the light of this conceptual framework, we then review and discuss recent experimental studies with the aim of identifying important next steps to be taken and connections to other fields that should be explored.},

We found little evidence for the bipolar or bivalent hypotheses. Findings instead supported the hypothesis that, at the level of brain activity measurable by fMRI, valence is flexibly implemented across instances by a set of valence-general limbic and paralimbic brain regions.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Entropy is a dimensionless quantity that is used for measuring uncertainty about the state of a system but it can also imply physical qualities, where high entropy is synonymous with high disorder. Entropy is applied here in the context of states of consciousness and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of “primary states” is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional connectivity motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit “criticality,” i.e., the property of being poised at a “critical” point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear. Moreover, if primary states are critical, then this suggests that entropy is suppressed in normal waking consciousness, meaning that the brain operates just below criticality. It is argued that this entropy suppression furnishes normal waking consciousness with a constrained quality and associated metacognitive functions, including reality-testing and self-awareness. It is also proposed that entry into primary states depends on a collapse of the normally highly organized activity within the default-mode network (DMN) and a decoupling between the DMN and the medial temporal lobes (which are normally significantly coupled). These hypotheses can be tested by examining brain activity and associated cognition in other candidate primary states such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and early psychosis and comparing these with non-primary states such as normal waking consciousness and the anaesthetized state.},

	abstract = {One prominent view holds that episodic memory emerged recently in humans and lacks a “(neo)Darwinian evolution” [Tulving E (2002) Annu Rev Psychol 53:1-25]. Here, we review evidence supporting the alternative perspective that episodic memory has a long evolutionary history. We show that fundamental features of episodic memory capacity are present in mammals and birds and that the major brain regions responsible for episodic memory in humans have anatomical and functional homologs in other species. We propose that episodic memory capacity depends on a fundamental neural circuit that is similar across mammalian and avian species, suggesting that protoepisodic memory systems exist across amniotes and, possibly, all vertebrates. The implication is that episodic memory in diverse species may primarily be due to a shared underlying neural ancestry, rather than the result of evolutionary convergence. We also discuss potential advantages that episodic memory may offer, as well as species-specific divergences that have developed on top of the fundamental episodic memory architecture. We conclude by identifying possible time points for the emergence of episodic memory in evolution, to help guide further research in this area.},

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

How this low-dimensional manifold scales with cognitive complexity, and which brain regions regulate this process, are not well understood.

We show that task performance reconfigures the low-dimensional manifold and that deviations from these patterns relate to performance errors. We further demonstrate that individual differences in thalamic activity relate to reconfigurations of the low-dimensional architecture during task engagement.},

Its total shrinkage-corrected surface area (1,590 cm2) was larger than expected or previously reported, equal to 78\% of the total surface area of the human neocortex. The unfolded and flattened surface comprised a narrow strip 10 cm wide but almost 1 m long. By applying the same methods to the neocortex and cerebellum of the macaque monkey, we found that its cerebellum was relatively much smaller, approximately 33\% of the total surface area of its neocortex. This suggests a prominent role for the cerebellum in the evolution of distinctively human behaviors and cognition.},

Neuroimaging has been pivotal in the modern era of psychedelic research, providing crucial insights into the acute effects of these drugs that revealed translational, clinical potential. Here we review this evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography studies and describe how these findings inform computational models of both the acute action of psychedelics and their longer-term therapeutic effects. This approach, based on multi-modal neuroimaging, provides a solid evidence base for these therapies as they move forwards, as well as a fuller understanding of the powerful effects of psychedelics on the phenomenology of human consciousness.},

	abstract = {Background
Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.

Methods
We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20\% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291.

Findings
We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95\% credible interval [CrI] 1·89–2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16–1·63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95\% CrI 0·72–0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80–0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01–1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19–1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51–0·84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43–0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30–2·32). 46 (9\%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73\%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18\%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low.

Interpretation
All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.

	abstract = {The spectrum of depression is much wider than that reflected in the current diagnostic nomenclature. A large proportion of subjects with depression both in treatment and in the community fail to meet diagnostic criteria for either major depressive disorder (MDD) or dysthymia. Inclusion of subthreshold categories of depression dramatically improves the coverage of treated depression, particularly in community samples, and better enables the characterization of its longitudinal course. This paper investigates the application of diagnostic criteria for both threshold and subthreshold categories of depression in a prospective longitudinal community study of young adults from Zurich, Switzerland. We present the prevalence and treatment rates of each of the depressive subtypes, the degree of diagnostic overlap and the longitudinal stability of subthreshold and threshold categories of depression. The findings indicate that the prevalence rates of subthreshold categories of depression are quite high in the community, and that a substantial proportion of subthreshold depressives, particularly those with recurrent depression, receive treatment. There is a strong tendency for individuals to meet multiple depressive subtypes over time, with little stability of individual categories among those who continue to manifest depression over a 15-year period. The prospective longitudinal data reveal that major depression is both an antecedent to and sequela of subthreshold categories, providing evidence for the validity of the spectrum concept of depression. However, the need for a threshold for the symptom criteria is suggested by the lack of predictive value of minor depression and depressive symptoms only. These result suggest that both the current symptom threshold for a depressive syndrome and recurrence, but not the minimum duration of depressive episodes, are important components of the classification of depression.},

        , Simulations of neural networks can be used to study the direct effect of internal or external changes on brain dynamics. However, some changes are not immediate but occur on the timescale of weeks, months, or years. Examples include effects of strokes, surgical tissue removal, or traumatic brain injury but also gradual changes during brain development. Simulating network activity over a long time, even for a small number of nodes, is a computational challenge. Here, we model a coupled network of human brain regions with a modified Wilson-Cowan model representing dynamics for each region and with synaptic plasticity adjusting connection weights within and between regions. Using strategies ranging from different models for plasticity, vectorization and a different differential equation solver setup, we achieved one second runtime for one second biological time.},

Here, we provide such a detailed causal explanation using a whole-brain model integrating multimodal imaging in healthy human participants undergoing manipulation of the serotonin system. Specifically, we combined anatomical data from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with neurotransmitter data obtained with positron emission tomography (PET) of the detailed serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) density map. This allowed us to model the resting state (with and without concurrent music listening) and mechanistically explain the functional effects of 5-HT2AR stimulation with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on healthy participants. The whole-brain model used a dynamical mean-field quantitative description of populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as the associated synaptic dynamics, where the neuronal gain function of the model is modulated by the 5-HT2AR density. The model identified the causative mechanisms for the non-linear interactions between the neuronal and neurotransmitter system, which are uniquely linked to (1) the underlying anatomical connectivity, (2) the modulation by the specific brainwide distribution of neurotransmitter receptor density, and (3) the non-linear interactions between the two. Taking neuromodulatory activity into account when modeling global brain dynamics will lead to novel insights into human brain function in health and disease and opens exciting possibilities for drug discovery and design in neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a promising treatment for select patients with refractory major depressive disorder (MDD). The clinical effectiveness of DBS for MDD has been demonstrated in meta-analyses, open-label studies, and a few controlled studies. However, randomized controlled trials have yielded mixed outcomes, highlighting challenges that must be addressed prior to widespread adoption of DBS for MDD. These challenges include tracking MDD symptoms objectively to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of DBS with sensitivity and specificity, identifying the patient population that is most likely to benefit from DBS, selecting the optimal patient-specific surgical target and stimulation parameters, and understanding the mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic benefits of DBS in the context of MDD pathophysiology. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest clinical evidence of MDD DBS effectiveness and the recent technological advancements that could transform our understanding of MDD pathophysiology, improve the clinical outcomes for MDD DBS, and establish a path forward to develop more effective neuromodulation therapies to alleviate depressive symptoms.},

	abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space–time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

	abstract = {The presence of symmetries imposes a stringent set of constraints on a system. This constrained structure allows intelligent agents interacting with such a system to drastically improve the efficiency of learning and generalization, through the internalisation of the system's symmetries into their information-processing. In parallel, principled models of complexity-constrained learning and behaviour make increasing use of information-theoretic methods. Here, we wish to marry these two perspectives and understand whether and in which form the information-theoretic lens can ``see'' the effect of symmetries of a system. For this purpose, we propose a novel variant of the Information Bottleneck principle, which has served as a productive basis for many principled studies of learning and information-constrained adaptive behaviour. We show (in the discrete case) that our approach formalises a certain duality between symmetry and information parsimony: namely, channel equivariances can be characterised by the optimal mutual information-preserving joint compression of the channel's input and output. This information-theoretic treatment furthermore suggests a principled notion of "soft" equivariance, whose "coarseness" is measured by the amount of input-output mutual information preserved by the corresponding optimal compression. This new notion offers a bridge between the field of bounded rationality and the study of symmetries in neural representations. The framework may also allow (exact and soft) equivariances to be automatically discovered.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder is a heterogeneous diagnostic category with multiple available treatments. With the goal of optimizing treatment selection, researchers are developing computational models that attempt to predict treatment response based on various pretreatment measures. In this paper, we review studies that use brain activity data to predict treatment response. Our aim is to highlight and clarify important methodological differences between various studies that relate to the incorporation of domain knowledge, specifically within two approaches delineated as data-driven and theory-driven. We argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach that is only beginning to be utilized in treatment response prediction. The predictors extracted via such models could improve interpretability, which is critical for clinical decision-making. We also identify several methodological limitations across the reviewed studies and provide suggestions for addressing them. Namely, we consider problems with dichotomizing treatment outcomes, the importance of investigating more than one treatment in a given study for differential treatment response predictions, the need for a patient-centered approach for defining treatment outcomes, and finally, the use of internal and external validation methods for improving model generalizability.Individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) vary in their response to available treatments, rendering treatment selection a challenging task. In this paper, we review studies applying computational models for predicting treatment response in MDD based on measures of brain activity. We discuss methodological differences across studies, focusing on how they incorporate existing knowledge about MDD and how that affects interpretability of model predictions. In this context, we argue that theory-driven generative modeling, which explicitly models information processing in the brain and thus can capture disease mechanisms, is a promising emerging approach for treatment response prediction. Finally, we identify several other important limitations that are holding back the translation of these tools into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Psychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition.},

	abstract = {Computers may be thought of as engines for transforming free energy into waste heat and mathematical work. Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energykT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20–100kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be renderedlogically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force ofkTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability.},

However, biological neural networks have asymmetrical connections, at the very least because of the separation between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain. We study characteristic differences between asymmetrical networks and their symmetrical counterparts in cases for which they act as selective amplifiers for particular classes of input patterns. We show that the dramatically different dynamical behaviours to which they have access, often make the asymmetrical networks computationally superior.

	abstract = {Cognitive functions are stored in the connectome, the wiring diagram of the brain, which exhibits non-random features, so-called motifs. In this work, we focus on bidirectional, symmetric motifs, i.e. two neurons that project to each other via connections of equal strength, and unidirectional, non-symmetric motifs, i.e. within a pair of neurons only one neuron projects to the other. We hypothesise that such motifs have been shaped via activity dependent synaptic plasticity processes. As a consequence, learning moves the distribution of the synaptic connections away from randomness. Our aim is to provide a global, macroscopic, single parameter characterisation of the statistical occurrence of bidirectional and unidirectional motifs. To this end we define a symmetry measure that does not require any a priori thresholding of the weights or knowledge of their maximal value. We calculate its mean and variance for random uniform or Gaussian distributions, which allows us to introduce a confidence measure of how significantly symmetric or asymmetric a specific configuration is, i.e. how likely it is that the configuration is the result of chance. We demonstrate the discriminatory power of our symmetry measure by inspecting the eigenvalues of different types of connectivity matrices. We show that a Gaussian weight distribution biases the connectivity motifs to more symmetric configurations than a uniform distribution and that introducing a random synaptic pruning, mimicking developmental regulation in synaptogenesis, biases the connectivity motifs to more asymmetric configurations, regardless of the distribution. We expect that our work will benefit the computational modelling community, by providing a systematic way to characterise symmetry and asymmetry in network structures. Further, our symmetry measure will be of use to electrophysiologists that investigate symmetry of network connectivity.},

	abstract = {The ultimate goal of neuroscience is to ultimately understand how the brain functions. The advancement of brain imaging shows us how the brain continuously alternates complex activity patterns and experimentally reveals how these patterns are responsible for memory, association, reasoning, and countless other tasks. Two fundamental parameters, dilution (the number of connections per node), and symmetry (the number of bidirectional connections of the same weight) characterise two fundamental features underlying the networks that connect the single neurons in the brain and generate these patterns. Mammalian brains show large variations of dilution, and mostly asymmetric connectivity, unfortunately the advantages which drove evolution to these state of network dilution and asymmetry are still unknown. Here, we studied the effects of symmetry and dilution on a discrete-time recurrent neural network with McCulloch–Pitts neurons. We use an exhaustive approach, in which we probe all possible inputs for several randomly connected neuron networks with different degrees of dilution and symmetry. We find an optimum value for the synaptic dilution and symmetry, which turns out to be in striking quantitative agreement with what previous researchers have found in the brain cortex, neocortex and hippocampus. The diluted asymmetric brain shows high memory capacity and pattern recognition speed, but most of all it is the less energy-consumptive with respect to fully connected and symmetric network topologies.},

Here we applied dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis to clinical data to generate a clinical aging clock (PCAge) identifying signatures (principal components) separating healthy and unhealthy aging trajectories. We found signatures of metabolic dysregulation, cardiac and renal dysfunction and inflammation that predict unsuccessful aging, and we demonstrate that these processes can be impacted using well-established drug interventions. Furthermore, we generated a streamlined aging clock (LinAge), based directly on PCAge, which maintains equivalent predictive power but relies on substantially fewer features. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can be tailored to individual datasets, by re-training a custom clinical clock (CALinAge), for use in the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) study of caloric restriction. Our analysis of CALERIE participants suggests that 2 years of mild caloric restriction significantly reduces biological age. Altogether, we demonstrate that this dimensionality reduction approach, through integrating different biological markers, can provide targets for preventative medicine and the promotion of healthy aging.},

	abstract = {Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.},

Correlations between the phase precession and behavior have been observed throughout various brain regions. As such, phase precession is suggested to be a global neural mechanism that promotes local neuroplasticity. However, causal evidence and neuroplastic mechanisms of phase precession are lacking so far. Here we show a causal link between LFP dynamics and phase precession. In three experiments, we modulated LFPs in humans, a non-human primate, and computational models using alternating current stimulation. We show that continuous stimulation of motor cortex oscillations in humans lead to a gradual phase shift of maximal corticospinal excitability by {\textasciitilde}90°. Further, exogenous alternating current stimulation induced phase precession in a subset of entrained neurons ({\textasciitilde}30\%) in the non-human primate. Multiscale modeling of realistic neural circuits suggests that alternating current stimulation-induced phase precession is driven by NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity. Altogether, the three experiments provide mechanistic and causal evidence for phase precession as a global neocortical process. Alternating current-induced phase precession and consequently synaptic plasticity is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic neuromodulation methods.},

Understanding the molecular changes underlying aging and identifying therapeutic targets for aging-related diseases are crucial for increasing healthspan. Although many studies have explored linear changes during aging, the prevalence of aging-related diseases and mortality risk accelerates after specific time points, indicating the importance of studying nonlinear molecular changes. In this study, we performed comprehensive multi-omics profiling on a longitudinal human cohort of 108 participants, aged between 25 years and 75 years. The participants resided in California, United States, and were tracked for a median period of 1.7 years, with a maximum follow-up duration of 6.8 years. The analysis revealed consistent nonlinear patterns in molecular markers of aging, with substantial dysregulation occurring at two major periods occurring at approximately 44 years and 60 years of chronological age. Distinct molecules and functional pathways associated with these periods were also identified, such as immune regulation and carbohydrate metabolism that shifted during the 60-year transition and cardiovascular disease, lipid and alcohol metabolism changes at the 40-year transition. Overall, this research demonstrates that functions and risks of aging-related diseases change nonlinearly across the human lifespan and provides insights into the molecular and biological pathways involved in these changes.},

Incidentally, in recent years, the machine learning community has focused on training increasingly large and powerful self-supervised (language) models. Since these large language models exhibit impressive predictive capabilities, they are well-positioned to be strong compressors. In this work, we advocate for viewing the prediction problem through the lens of compression and evaluate the compression capabilities of large (foundation) models. We show that large language models are powerful general-purpose predictors and that the compression viewpoint provides novel insights into scaling laws, tokenization, and in-context learning. For example, Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4\% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4\% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5\%) or FLAC (30.3\%), respectively.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

The science of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be defined as the construction of intelligent systems and their analysis. A natural definition of a system is anything which has an input and an output stream. Intelligence is more complicated. It can have many faces like creativity, solving problems, pattern recognition, classification, learning, induction, deduction, building analogies, optimization, surviving in an environment, language processing, knowledge, and many more. A formal definition incorporating every aspect of intelligence, however, seems difficult. Most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal},

	abstract = {1. Summary
In Part I, four ostensibly different theoretical models of induction are presented, in which the problem dealt with is the extrapolation of a very long sequence of symbols—presumably containing all of the information to be used in the induction. Almost all, if not all problems in induction can be put in this form. Some strong heuristic arguments have been obtained for the equivalence of the last three models. One of these models is equivalent to a Bayes formulation, in which a priori probabilities are assigned to sequences of symbols on the basis of the lengths of inputs to a universal Turing machine that are required to produce the sequence of interest as output. Though it seems likely, it is not certain whether the first of the four models is equivalent to the other three. Few rigorous results are presented. Informal investigations are made of the properties of these models. There are discussions of their consistency and meaningfulness, of their degree of independence of the exact nature of the Turing machine used, and of the accuracy of their predictions in comparison to those of other induction methods. In Part II these models are applied to the solution of three problems—prediction of the Bernoulli sequence, extrapolation of a certain kind of Markov chain, and the use of phrase structure grammars for induction. Though some approximations are used, the first of these problems is treated most rigorously. The result is Laplace's rule of succession. The solution to the second problem uses less certain approximations, but the properties of the solution that are discussed, are fairly independent of these approximations. The third application, using phrase structure grammars, is least exact of the three. First a formal solution is presented. Though it appears to have certain deficiencies, it is hoped that presentation of this admittedly inadequate model will suggest acceptable improvements in it. This formal solution is then applied in an approximate way to the determination of the “optimum” phrase structure grammar for a given set of strings. The results that are obtained are plausible, but subject to the uncertainties of the approximation used.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is defined by the abrupt emergence of harmful seizures, but the nature of these regime shifts remains enigmatic. From the perspective of dynamical systems theory, such critical transitions occur upon inconspicuous perturbations in highly interconnected systems and can be modeled as mathematical bifurcations between alternative regimes. The predictability of critical transitions represents a major challenge, but the theory predicts the appearance of subtle dynamical signatures on the verge of instability. Whether such dynamical signatures can be measured before impending seizures remains uncertain. Here, we verified that predictions on bifurcations applied to the onset of hippocampal seizures, providing concordant results from in silico modeling, optogenetics experiments in male mice and intracranial EEG recordings in human patients with epilepsy. Leveraging pharmacological control over neural excitability, we showed that the boundary between physiological excitability and seizures can be inferred from dynamical signatures passively recorded or actively probed in hippocampal circuits. Of importance for the design of future neurotechnologies, active probing surpassed passive recording to decode underlying levels of neural excitability, notably when assessed from a network of propagating neural responses. Our findings provide a promising approach for predicting and preventing seizures, based on a sound understanding of their dynamics.},

How these robust dynamics persist remains unclear, given the many stochastic reactions and shorter time scales demonstrated by underlying components. We propose a topological model that produces long oscillations around the network boundary, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current in a robust manner. Using this to model KaiC, which regulates the circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria, we compare the coherence of oscillations to that in other KaiC models. Our topological model localizes currents on the system edge, with an efficient regime of simultaneously increased precision and decreased cost. Further, we introduce a new predictor of coherence from the analysis of spectral gaps, and show that our model saturates a global thermodynamic bound.

Central to this capacity is the ability to form high-level, abstract representations that take advantage of regularities in the world to support generalization1. However, little is known about how these representations are encoded in populations of neurons, how they emerge through learning and how they relate to behaviour2,3. Here we characterized the representational geometry of populations of neurons (single units) recorded in the hippocampus, amygdala, medial frontal cortex and ventral temporal cortex of neurosurgical patients performing an inferential reasoning task. We found that only the neural representations formed in the hippocampus simultaneously encode several task variables in an abstract, or disentangled, format. This representational geometry is uniquely observed after patients learn to perform inference, and consists of disentangled directly observable and discovered latent task variables. Learning to perform inference by trial and error or through verbal instructions led to the formation of hippocampal representations with similar geometric properties. The observed relation between representational format and inference behaviour suggests that abstract and disentangled representational geometries are important for complex cognition.},

This aspect is currently a subject of debate and this article provides an overview of some of the relevant publications on this topic. We develop the argument that agency is immanent in living organisms. There is no life without agency. Even the basic life processes are an intrinsic activity, which we call the organismic level of agency. In addition to this we describe several further levels. These capture different qualities that occur or transform during evolution. In addition to the organismic level, we propose an ontogenetic level, a level of directed agency, directed agency with extended flexibility, and a level that includes the capacities to follow preconceived goals. A further property of organisms is their autonomy. It has been shown that the capacity for autonomy changed during evolution. Here we propose that the two organismic properties autonomy and agency are closely related. Enhanced physiological and behavioral autonomy extends the scope of self-generated, flexible actions and reactions. The increase in autonomy through the evolution of a widened scope of behavioral possibilities and versatility in organisms coincides with extended levels of agency. Especially the human organization, including the sophisticated brain, is the basis for an extended level of agency referring to the capacities to follow preconceived goals. However, it is important for the understanding of the phenomenon of agency not only to assume this latter form, but also to look at the different levels of agency.},

Yet, how such systems may specifically communicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective dynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective dynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing patterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy measures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of this mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyse how individual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs co-act to systematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular architectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local interventions within one sub-network may remotely determine nonlocal network-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing information routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs with a communication function., 
Flexible information routing underlies the function of many biological and artificial networks. Here, the authors present a theoretical framework that shows how information can be flexibly routed across networks using collective reference dynamics and how local changes may induce remote rerouting.},

	abstract = {Research on brain oscillations has brought up a picture of coupled oscillators. Some of the most important questions that will be analyzed are, how many frequencies are there, what are the coupling principles, what their functional meaning is, and whether body oscillations follow similar coupling principles. It is argued that physiologically, two basic coupling principles govern brain as well as body oscillations: (i) amplitude (envelope) modulation between any frequencies m and n, where the phase of the slower frequency m modulates the envelope of the faster frequency n, and (ii) phase coupling between m and n, where the frequency of n is a harmonic multiple of m. An analysis of the center frequency of traditional frequency bands and their coupling principles suggest a binary hierarchy of frequencies. This principle leads to the foundation of the binary hierarchy brain body oscillation theory. Its central hypotheses are that the frequencies of body oscillations can be predicted from brain oscillations and that brain and body oscillations are aligned to each other. The empirical evaluation of the predicted frequencies for body oscillations is discussed on the basis of findings for heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing frequencies, fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and other body oscillations. The conclusion is that brain and many body oscillations can be described by a single system, where the cross talk – reflecting communication – within and between brain and body oscillations is governed by m : n phase to envelope and phase to phase coupling.},

One of the most notable neurophysiological signatures of psychedelics, increased entropy in spontaneous neural activity, is thought to be of relevance to the psychedelic experience, mediating both acute alterations in consciousness and long-term effects. However, no clear mechanistic explanation for this entropy increase has been put forward so far. We sought to do this here by building upon a recent whole-brain model of serotonergic neuromodulation, to study the entropic effects of 5HT2A-R activation. Our results reproduce the overall entropy increase observed in previous experiments in vivo, providing the first model-based explanation for this phenomenon. We also found that entropy changes were not uniform across the brain: entropy increased in all regions, but the larger effect were localised in visuo-occipital regions. Interestingly, at the whole-brain level, this reconfiguration was not well explained by 5HT2A-R density, but related closely to the topological properties of the brain’s anatomical connectivity. These results help us understand the mechanisms underlying the psychedelic state and, more generally, the pharmacological modulation of whole-brain activity.},

Here we review evidence from neurochemical, tract-tracing, developmental, and functional lesion/stimulation studies that delineates homology relationships for most of the nodes of these two circuits across the five major vertebrate lineages: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and teleost fish. We provide for the first time a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two neural circuits and conclude that they were already present in early vertebrates. We also propose that these circuits form a larger social decision-making (SDM) network that regulates adaptive behavior.

	abstract = {Personalized whole-brain computational modelling of emergent brain dynamics, where the models are fitted with individual experimental data, has become increasingly important for understanding the systems-level mechanisms governing large-scale brain activity in health and disease. Healthy brain dynamics is characterized by oscillatory synchronization and brain criticality, which are fundamental for cognitive functions. Abnormal dynamics likely has a mechanistic relationship with several brain disorders. Current modelling and model fitting approaches reconstruct well the individual functional-connectivity patterns observed, e.g., in fMRI. However, there are no model-fitting approaches that would yield personalized models with in-vivo-like critical synchronization dynamics observable with electrophysiological methods. Here, we advance a new Hierarchical Kuramoto model, of which the simplest realization has two layers and comprises a network of nodes that each contain a large number of coupled oscillators. Already at two levels of hierarchy, this model enables explicit representation of local and inter-areal coupling and observations of emergent multi-scale synchronization dynamics. We show here that the model produces biologically plausible meso- and macro-scale synchronization dynamics and is directly comparable with electrophysiological magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) data. We then advance a novel approach for fitting this model with individual experimental data, which uses not only functional connectivity but also criticality to obtain personalized model parameters with individual M/EEG and structural-connectivity. We posit that models with personalized brain synchronization dynamics will support both clinical applications and basic research on the systems-level mechanisms of cognitive functions. The model and model-fitting approach advanced here open new avenues for mechanistic understanding of experimental observations and generation of testable predictions for future research.},

	abstract = {Neuronal oscillations represent the most obvious feature of electrical activity in the brain. They are linked in general with global brain state (awake, asleep, etc.) and specifically with organisation of neuronal outputs during sensory perception and cognitive processing. Oscillations can be generated by individual neurons on the basis of interaction between inputs and intrinsic conductances but are far more commonly seen at the local network level in populations of interconnected neurons with diverse arrays of functional properties. It is at this level that the brain’s rich and diverse library of oscillatory time constants serve to temporally organise large-scale neural activity patterns. The discipline is relatively mature at the microscopic (cell, local network) level – although novel discoveries are still commonplace – but requires a far greater understanding of mesoscopic and macroscopic brain dynamics than we currently hold. Without this, extrapolation from the temporal properties of neurons and their communication strategies up to whole brain function will remain largely theoretical. However, recent advances in large-scale neuronal population recordings and more direct, higher fidelity, non-invasive measurement of whole brain function suggest much progress is just around the corner.},

Recent interest in non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been, however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether a physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract computational level interacts with the physical device level, in comparison with the use of mathematical models in experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of experiments, technology, computation and simulation, giving our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions for computing, illustrated using a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer user. We introduce the notion of a ‘computational entity’, and its critical role in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.},

In this article, I review the long argument made by Schrödinger as he mused on how the laws of physics could help us understand "the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism." Though Schrödinger's book is often hailed for its influence on some of the titans who founded molecular biology, this article takes a different tack. Instead of exploring the way the book touched biologists such as James Watson and Francis Crick, as well as its critical reception by others such as Linus Pauling and Max Perutz, I argue that Schrödinger's classic is a timeless manifesto, rather than a dated historical curiosity. \textit{What Is Life?} is full of timely outlooks and approaches to understanding the mysterious living world that includes and surrounds us and can instead be viewed as a call to arms to tackle the great unanswered challenges in the study of living matter that remain for 21st century science.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mapping human brain function is a long-standing goal of neuroscience that promises to inform the development of new treatments for brain disorders. Early maps of human brain function were based on locations of brain damage or brain stimulation that caused a functional change. Over time, this approach was largely replaced by technologies such as functional neuroimaging, which identify brain regions in which activity is correlated with behaviours or symptoms. Despite their advantages, these technologies reveal correlations, not causation. This creates challenges for interpreting the data generated from these tools and using them to develop treatments for brain disorders. A return to causal mapping of human brain function based on brain lesions and brain stimulation is underway. New approaches can combine these causal sources of information with modern neuroimaging and electrophysiology techniques to gain new insights into the functions of specific brain areas. In this Review, we provide a definition of causality for translational research, propose a continuum along which to assess the relative strength of causal information from human brain mapping studies and discuss recent advances in causal brain mapping and their relevance for developing treatments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Treatment of different depression symptoms may require different brain stimulation targets with different underlying brain circuits. The authors sought to identify such targets, which could improve the efficacy of therapeutic brain stimulation and facilitate personalized therapy.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed two independent cohorts of patients who received left prefrontal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment of depression (discovery sample, N=30; active replication sample, N=81; sham replication sample, N=87). Each patient's TMS site was mapped to underlying brain circuits using functional connectivity MRI from a large connectome database (N=1,000). Circuits associated with improvement in each depression symptom were identified and then clustered based on similarity. The authors tested for reproducibility across data sets and whether symptom-specific targets derived from one data set could predict symptom improvement in the other independent cohort.
RESULTS: The authors identified two distinct circuit targets effective for two discrete clusters of depressive symptoms. Dysphoric symptoms, such as sadness and anhedonia, responded best to stimulation of one circuit, while anxiety and somatic symptoms responded best to stimulation of a different circuit. These circuit maps were reproducible, predicted symptom improvement in independent patient cohorts, and were specific to active compared with sham stimulation. The maps predicted symptom improvement in an exploratory analysis of stimulation sites from 14 clinical TMS trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Distinct clusters of depressive symptoms responded better to different TMS targets across independent retrospective data sets. These symptom-specific targets can be prospectively tested in a randomized clinical trial. This data-driven approach for identifying symptom-specific targets may prove useful for other disorders and facilitate personalized neuromodulation therapy.},

To determine whether these circuits converge, we studied depression severity after brain lesions (n = 461, five datasets), transcranial magnetic stimulation (n = 151, four datasets) and deep brain stimulation (n = 101, five datasets). Lesions and stimulation sites most associated with depression severity were connected to a similar brain circuit across all 14 datasets (P {\textless} 0.001). Circuits derived from lesions, deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation were similar (P {\textless} 0.0005), as were circuits derived from patients with major depression versus other diagnoses (P {\textless} 0.001). Connectivity to this circuit predicted out-of-sample antidepressant efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation sites (P {\textless} 0.0001). In an independent analysis, 29 lesions and 95 stimulation sites converged on a distinct circuit for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (P {\textless} 0.05).

In animal models, psilocybin induces neuroplasticity in cortex and hippocampus5–8. It remains unclear how human brain network changes relate to subjective and lasting effects of psychedelics. Here we tracked individual-specific brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping (roughly 18 magnetic resonance imaging visits per participant). Healthy adults were tracked before, during and for 3 weeks after high-dose psilocybin (25 mg) and methylphenidate (40 mg), and brought back for an additional psilocybin dose 6–12 months later. Psilocybin massively disrupted functional connectivity (FC) in cortex and subcortex, acutely causing more than threefold greater change than methylphenidate. These FC changes were driven by brain desynchronization across spatial scales (areal, global), which dissolved network distinctions by reducing correlations within and anticorrelations between networks. Psilocybin-driven FC changes were strongest in the default mode network, which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and is thought to create our sense of space, time and self. Individual differences in FC changes were strongly linked to the subjective psychedelic experience. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-driven FC changes. Psilocybin caused persistent decrease in FC between the anterior hippocampus and default mode network, lasting for weeks. Persistent reduction of hippocampal-default mode network connectivity may represent a neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate of the proplasticity and therapeutic effects of psychedelics.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a very prevalent mental disorder that imposes an enormous burden on individuals, society, and health care systems. Most patients benefit from commonly used treatment methods such as pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). However, the clinical decision on which treatment method to use remains generally informed and the individual clinical response is difficult to predict. Most likely, a combination of neural variability and heterogeneity in MDD still impedes a full understanding of the disorder, as well as influences treatment success in many cases. With the help of neuroimaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), the brain can be understood as a modular set of functional and structural networks. In recent years, many studies have investigated baseline connectivity biomarkers of treatment response and the connectivity changes after successful treatment. Here, we systematically review the literature and summarize findings from longitudinal interventional studies investigating the functional and structural connectivity in MDD. By compiling and discussing these findings, we recommend the scientific and clinical community to deepen the systematization of findings to pave the way for future systems neuroscience roadmaps that include brain connectivity parameters as a possible precision component of the clinical evaluation and therapeutic decision.},

As this neuropsychiatric disorder causes the patients to suffer a lot and function poorly in everyday life, it is imposing a heavy burden on the affected families and the whole society. Several hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the pathogenesis of depression, such as the genetic mutations, the monoamine hypothesis, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivation, the inflammation and the neural plasticity changes. Among these models, neural plasticity can occur at multiple levels from brain regions, cells to synapses structurally and functionally during development and in adulthood. In this review, we summarize the recent progresses (especially in the last five years) on the neural plasticity changes in depression under different organizational levels and elaborate different treatments for depression by changing the neural plasticity.

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Corticostriatal circuits through the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) play key roles in complex human behaviors such as evaluation, affect regulation and reward-based decision-making. Importantly, the medial and lateral OFC (mOFC and lOFC) circuits have functionally and anatomically distinct connectivity profiles which differentially contribute to the various aspects of goal-directed behavior. OFC corticostriatal circuits have been consistently implicated across a wide range of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and substance use disorders (SUDs). Furthermore, psychiatric disorders related to OFC corticostriatal dysfunction can be addressed via conventional and novel neurostimulatory techniques, including deep brain stimulation (DBS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Such techniques elicit changes in OFC corticostriatal activity, resulting in changes in clinical symptomatology. Here we review the available literature regarding how disturbances in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal functioning may lead to psychiatric symptomatology in the aforementioned disorders, and how psychiatric treatments may exert their therapeutic effect by rectifying abnormal OFC corticostriatal activity. First, we review the role of OFC corticostriatal circuits in reward-guided learning, decision-making, affect regulation and reappraisal. Second, we discuss the role of OFC corticostriatal circuit dysfunction across a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Third, we review available evidence that the therapeutic mechanisms of various neuromodulation techniques may directly involve rectifying abnormal activity in mOFC and lOFC corticostriatal circuits. Finally, we examine the potential of future applications of therapeutic brain stimulation targeted at OFC circuitry; specifically, the role of OFC brain stimulation in the growing field of individually-tailored therapies and personalized medicine in psychiatry.},

@article{rolls_functions_2004,
	title = {The functions of the orbitofrontal cortex},
	volume = {55},
	abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex contains the secondary taste cortex, in which the reward value of taste is represented. It also contains the secondary and tertiary olfactory cortical areas, in which information about the identity and also about the reward value of odours is represented. The orbitofrontal cortex also receives information about the sight of objects from the temporal lobe cortical visual areas, and neurons in it learn and reverse the visual stimulus to which they respond when the association of the visual stimulus with a primary reinforcing stimulus (such as taste) is reversed. This is an example of stimulus-reinforcement association learning, and is a type of stimulus-stimulus association learning. More generally, the stimulus might be a visual or olfactory stimulus, and the primary (unlearned) positive or negative reinforcer a taste or touch. A somatosensory input is revealed by neurons that respond to the texture of food in the mouth, including a population that responds to the mouth feel of fat. In complementary neuroimaging studies in humans, it is being found that areas of the orbitofrontal cortex are activated by pleasant touch, by painful touch, by taste, by smell, and by more abstract reinforcers such as winning or losing money. Damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can impair the learning and reversal of stimulus-reinforcement associations, and thus the correction of behavioural responses when there are no longer appropriate because previous reinforcement contingencies change. The information which reaches the orbitofrontal cortex for these functions includes information about faces, and damage to the orbitofrontal cortex can impair face (and voice) expression identification. This evidence thus shows that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in decoding and representing some primary reinforcers such as taste and touch; in learning and reversing associations of visual and other stimuli to these primary reinforcers; and in controlling and correcting reward-related and punishment-related behavior, and thus in emotion. The approach described here is aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of how the orbitofrontal cortex actually functions, and thus in how it is involved in motivational behavior such as feeding and drinking, in emotional behavior, and in social behavior.},

Both regions contribute to the expression of defensive responses to a potential predator.

Understanding the etiology and related mechanisms is of great importance and might yield new therapeutic strategies to treat these diseases effectively. During the past decades, a growing number of studies have pointed out the importance of the stress-induced inflammatory response in the amygdala, a kernel region for processing emotional stimuli, as a potentially critical contributor to the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders. In this review, we first summarized the recent progress from both animal and human studies toward understanding the causal link between stress-induced inflammation and depression and anxiety disorders, with particular emphasis on findings showing the effect of inflammation on the functional changes in neurons in the amygdala, at levels ranging from molecular signaling, cellular function, synaptic plasticity, and the neural circuit to behavior, as well as their contributions to the pathology of inflammation-related depression and anxiety disorders. Finally, we concluded by discussing some of the difficulties surrounding the current research and propose some issues worth future study in this field.},

There is evidence that this holds for taste, visual, somatosensory and olfactory stimuli. The human medial orbitofrontal cortex represents many different types of reward, and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex represents non-reward and punishment. Not obtaining an expected reward can lead to sadness, and feeling depressed. The concept is advanced that an important brain region in depression is the orbitofrontal cortex, with depression related to over-responsiveness and over-connectedness of the non-reward-related lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and to under-responsiveness and under-connectivity of the reward-related medial orbitofrontal cortex. Evidence from large-scale voxel-level studies and supported by an activation study is described that provides support for this hypothesis. Increased functional connectivity of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex with brain areas that include the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus is found in patients with depression and is reduced towards the levels in controls when treated with medication. Decreased functional connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex with medial temporal lobe areas involved in memory is found in patients with depression. Some treatments for depression may act by reducing activity or connectivity of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex. New treatments that increase the activity or connectivity of the medial orbitofrontal cortex may be useful for depression. These concepts, and that of increased activity in non-reward attractor networks, have potential for advancing our understanding and treatment of depression. The focus is on the orbitofrontal cortex in primates including humans, because of differences of operation of the orbitofrontal cortex, and indeed of reward systems, in rodents. Finally, the hypothesis is developed that the orbitofrontal cortex has a special role in emotion and decision-making in part because as a cortical area it can implement attractor networks useful in maintaining reward and emotional states online, and in decision-making.},

Over the past 5 years, there has been increasing interest in the active, adaptive coping mechanisms of resilience; however, in humans, most published work focuses on correlative neuroendocrine markers that are associated with a resilient phenotype. In this review, we highlight a growing literature in rodents that is starting to complement the human work by identifying the active behavioral, neural, molecular and hormonal basis of resilience. The therapeutic implications of these findings are important and can pave the way for an innovative approach to drug development for a range of stress-related syndromes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Extending beyond the motor domain, the cerebellum is involved in various aspects of cognition and affect. Multidisciplinary evidence has demonstrated topographic organization of higher-order cognitive functions within the cerebellum. We here review recent neuroimaging research that indicates cerebellar contributions to major depressive disorder (MDD). At the structural level, increased volume of lobule IX has been demonstrated in MDD patients, independent of acute or remitted disease state. Successful treatment with electroconvulsive therapy has been associated with increased lobule VIIA volume in depressed patients. At the functional level, connectivity analyses have shown reduced cerebro-cerebellar coupling of lobules VI and VIIA/B with prefrontal, posterior parietal, and limbic regions in patients with MDD. As a limitation, most of this evidence is based on smaller patient samples with incomplete phenotypic and neuropsychological characterization and with heterogenous medication. Some studies did not apply cerebellum-optimized data analysis protocols. Taken together, MDD pathophysiology affects distinct subregions of the cerebellum that communicate with cortical networks subserving cognitive and self-referential processing. This mini-review synthesizes research evidence from cerebellar structural and functional neuroimaging in depression, and provides future perspectives for neuroimaging of cerebellar contributions to MDD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods We performed the first fully voxel-level resting-state functional connectivity (FC) neuroimaging analysis of depression of the precuneus, with 282 patients with major depressive disorder and 254 control subjects. Results In 125 unmedicated patients, voxels in the precuneus had significantly increased FC with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a region implicated in nonreward that is thereby implicated in depression. FC was also increased in depression between the precuneus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and angular and supramarginal areas. In patients receiving medication, the FC between the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and precuneus was decreased back toward that in the control subjects. In the 254 control subjects, parcellation revealed superior anterior, superior posterior, and inferior subdivisions, with the inferior subdivision having high connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, angular gyrus, and prefrontal cortex. It was the ventral subdivision of the precuneus that had increased connectivity in depression with the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and adjoining inferior frontal gyrus. Conclusions The findings support the theory that the system in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex implicated in the response to nonreceipt of expected rewards has increased effects on areas in which the self is represented, such as the precuneus. This may result in low self-esteem in depression. The increased connectivity of the precuneus with the prefrontal cortex short-term memory system may contribute to the rumination about low self-esteem in depression. These findings provide evidence that a target to ameliorate depression is the lateral orbitofrontal cortex.},

Methods In total 66 MDD patients and 57 healthy controls were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. After four weeks of treatment with Escitalopram or Venlafaxine, patients were divided into subgroups with remitters (R, n = 31) and non-remitters (NR, n = 35). Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to compare intranetwork functional connectivity (intra-FC) in DMN between the three groups. Results Relative to NR-MDD group and HCs, the R-MDD group showed significantly higher intra-FC in the right angular gyrus of DMN, and the intra-FC was positively correlated with the reduction ratio of the depressive symptom scores. The ROC curve analysis revealed that intra-FC exhibited a high diagnostic value for remission. Conclusion These findings indicated that intra-FC related to the DMN is a prognostic marker that can potentially predict early remission of symptoms after antidepressant treatment.},

	abstract = {Attention is the gate through which sensory information enters our conscious experiences. Oftentimes, patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) complain of concentration difficulties that negatively impact their day-to-day function, and these attention problems are not alleviated by current first-line treatments. In spite of attention's influence on many aspects of cognitive and emotional functioning, and the inclusion of concentration difficulties in the diagnostic criteria for MDD, the focus of depression as a disease is typically on mood features, with attentional features considered less of an imperative for investigation. Here, we summarize the breadth and depth of findings from the cognitive neurosciences regarding the neural mechanisms supporting goal-directed attention in order to better understand how these might go awry in depression. First, we characterize behavioral impairments in selective, sustained, and divided attention in depressed individuals. We then discuss interactions between goal-directed attention and other aspects of cognition (cognitive control, perception, and decision-making) and emotional functioning (negative biases, internally-focused attention, and interactions of mood and attention). We then review evidence for neurobiological mechanisms supporting attention, including the organization of large-scale neural networks and electrophysiological synchrony. Finally, we discuss the failure of current first-line treatments to alleviate attention impairments in MDD and review evidence for more targeted pharmacological, brain stimulation, and behavioral interventions. By synthesizing findings across disciplines and delineating avenues for future research, we aim to provide a clearer outline of how attention impairments may arise in the context of MDD and how, mechanistically, they may negatively impact daily functioning across various domains.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of the ventral striatum is critically involved in goal- and reward-based behavior. Structural and functional abnormalities of the NAcc or its associated neural systems are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Studies of neural circuitry have shed light on the subtleties of the structural and functional derangements of the NAcc across various diseases. In this systematic review, the authors sought to identify human studies involving the NAcc and provide a synthesis of the literature on the known circuity of the NAcc in healthy and diseased states, as well as the clinical outcomes following neuromodulation. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Neuroimaging studies that reported on neural circuitry related to the human NAcc with sample sizes greater than 5 patients were included. Demographic data, aim, design and duration, participants, and clinical and neurocircuitry details and outcomes of the studies were extracted. RESULTS: Of 3591 resultant articles, 123 were included. The NAcc and its corticolimbic connections to other brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, are largely involved in reward and pain processes, with distinct functional circuitry between the shell and core in healthy patients. There is heterogeneity between clinical studies with regard to the NAcc indirect targeting coordinates, methods for postoperative confirmation, and blinded trial design. Neuromodulation studies provided promising clinical results in the context of addiction and substance misuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and mood disorders. The most common complications were impaired memory or concentration, and a notable serious complication was hypomania. CONCLUSIONS: The functional diversity of the NAcc highlights the importance of studying the NAcc in healthy and pathological states. The results of this review suggest that NAcc neuromodulation has been attempted in the management of diverse psychiatric indications. There is promising, emerging evidence that the NAcc may be an effective target for specific reward- or pain-based pathologies with a reasonable risk profile.},

This review considers four classes of nonsynaptic interaction, mainly in mammalian brain. 1) Electrotonic (and chemical) coupling through gap junctions has effects during development and under some, often pathological, conditions in the mature brain. 2) Ephaptic transmission is mediated by electrical coupling between specific neuronal elements in the absence of specialized contacts, notably in the cerebellum, and in axon tracts affected by demyelination. 3) Field effect interactions are mediated by large extracellular currents and potential fields generated by the hippocampus and other cortical structures. Both endogenous and applied electric fields alter neuronal excitability at field strengths over a few millivolts per millimeter. Weaker fields have more subtle effects, for instance, on axonal growth during development and repair and, more controversially, in behavioral responses to environmental fields. 4) There are fluctuations in extracellular ions such as K+, which are released during neuronal activity and which alter neuronal excitability. Field effects and ion fluctuations probably have modest effects during physiological activity but have a significant impact on epileptic seizures, and can sustain them in the absence of synaptic transmission.},

	abstract = {Thirty years of brain imaging research has converged to define the brain's default network—a novel and only recently appreciated brain system that participates in internal modes of cognition. Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world. We conclude by discussing the relevance of the default network for understanding mental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Functional neuroimaging investigations of major depressive disorder can advance both the neural theory and treatment of this debilitating illness. Inconsistency of neuroimaging findings and the use of region-of-interest approaches have hindered the development of a comprehensive, empirically informed neural model of major depression. In this context, the authors sought to identify reliable anomalies in baseline neural activity and neural response to affective stimuli in major depressive disorder. METHOD: The authors applied voxel-wise, whole-brain meta-analysis to neuroimaging investigations comparing depressed to healthy comparison groups with respect to baseline neural activity or neural response to positively and/or negatively valenced stimuli. RESULTS: Relative to healthy subjects, those with major depression had reliably higher baseline activity, bilaterally, in the pulvinar nucleus. The analysis of neural response studies using negative stimuli showed greater response in the amygdala, insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and lower response in the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in individuals with major depressive disorder than in healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analytic results support an elegant and neuroanatomically viable model of the salience of negative information in major depressive disorder. In this proposed model, high baseline pulvinar activity in depression first potentiates responding of the brain's salience network to negative information; next, and owing potentially to low striatal dopamine levels in depression, this viscerally charged information fails to propagate up the cortical-striatal-pallidalthalamic circuit to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for contextual processing and reappraisal.},

	abstract = {Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated reliably with ruminative responding; this kind of responding is composed of both maladaptive and adaptive components. Levels of activity in the default-mode network (DMN) relative to the task-positive network (TPN), as well as activity in structures that influence DMN and TPN functioning, may represent important neural substrates of maladaptive and adaptive rumination in MDD. Methods We used a unique metric to estimate DMN dominance over TPN from blood oxygenation level-dependent data collected during eyes-closed rest in 17 currently depressed and 17 never-disordered adults. We calculated correlations between this metric of DMN dominance over TPN and the depressive, brooding, and reflective subscales of the Ruminative Responses Scale, correcting for associations between these measures both with one another and with severity of depression. Finally, we estimated and compared across groups right fronto-insular cortex (RFIC) response during initiations of ascent in DMN and in TPN activity. Results In the MDD participants, increasing levels of DMN dominance were associated with higher levels of maladaptive, depressive rumination and lower levels of adaptive, reflective rumination. Moreover, our RFIC state-change analysis showed increased RFIC activation in the MDD participants at the onset of increases in TPN activity; conversely, healthy control participants exhibited increased RFIC response at the onset of increases in DMN activity. Conclusions These findings support a formulation in which the DMN undergirds representation of negative, self-referential information in depression, and the RFIC, when prompted by increased levels of DMN activity, initiates an adaptive engagement of the TPN.},

Across ten different datasets of patients receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep brain stimulation (DBS),1,5,6 stimulation site connectivity to each of our two brain networks independently predicted improvement in depressive symptoms.

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Social anxiety disorder is thought to involve emotional hyperreactivity, cognitive distortions, and ineffective emotion regulation. While the neural bases of emotional reactivity to social stimuli have been described, the neural bases of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation during social and physical threat, and their relationship to social anxiety symptom severity, have yet to be investigated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate behavioral and neural correlates of emotional reactivity and cognitive regulation in patients and controls during processing of social and physical threat stimuli. DESIGN: Participants were trained to implement cognitive-linguistic regulation of emotional reactivity induced by social (harsh facial expressions) and physical (violent scenes) threat while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and providing behavioral ratings of negative emotion experience. SETTING: Academic psychology department. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen adults with social anxiety disorder and 17 demographically matched healthy controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood oxygen level-dependent signal and negative emotion ratings. RESULTS: Behaviorally, patients reported greater negative emotion than controls during social and physical threat but showed equivalent reduction in negative emotion following cognitive regulation. Neurally, viewing social threat resulted in greater emotion-related neural responses in patients than controls, with social anxiety symptom severity related to activity in a network of emotion- and attention-processing regions in patients only. Viewing physical threat produced no between-group differences. Regulation during social threat resulted in greater cognitive and attention regulation-related brain activation in controls compared with patients. Regulation during physical threat produced greater cognitive control-related response (ie, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) in patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with controls, patients demonstrated exaggerated negative emotion reactivity and reduced cognitive regulation-related neural activation, specifically for social threat stimuli. These findings help to elucidate potential neural mechanisms of emotion regulation that might serve as biomarkers for interventions for social anxiety disorder.},

	title = {Harmonic decomposition of spacetime ({HADES}) framework characterises the spacetime hierarchy of the {DMT} brain state},
	abstract = {AbstractThe human brain is a complex system, whose activity exhibits flexible and continuous reorganisation across space and time. The decomposition of whole-brain recordings into harmonic modes has revealed a repertoire of gradient-like activity patterns associated with distinct brain functions. However, the way these activity patterns are expressed over time with their changes in various brain states remains unclear. In this study, we develop the Harmonic Decomposition of Spacetime (HADES) framework that characterises how different harmonic modes defined inspaceare expressed overtime, and, as a proof-of-principle, demonstrate the sensitivity and robustness of this approach to specific changes induced by the serotonergic psychedelic N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in healthy participants. HADES demonstrates significant decreases in contributions across most low-frequency harmonic modes in the DMT-induced brain state. When normalizing the contributions by condition (DMT and non-DMT), we detect a decrease specifically in the second functional harmonic, which represents the uni- to transmodal functional hierarchy of the brain, supporting the hypothesis that functional hierarchy is changed in psychedelics. Moreover, HADES' dynamic spacetime measures of fractional occupancy, life time and latent space provide a precise description of the significant changes of the spacetime hierarchical organization of brain activity in the psychedelic state.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in systems neuroscience is how to force a transition from one brain state to another by external driven stimulation in, for example, wakefulness, sleep, coma, or neuropsychiatric diseases. This requires a quantitative and robust definition of a brain state, which has so far proven elusive. Here, we provide such a definition, which, together with whole-brain modeling, permits the systematic study in silico of how simulated brain stimulation can force transitions between different brain states in humans. Specifically, we use a unique neuroimaging dataset of human sleep to systematically investigate where to stimulate the brain to force an awakening of the human sleeping brain and vice versa. We show where this is possible using a definition of a brain state as an ensemble of “metastable substates,” each with a probabilistic stability and occurrence frequency fitted by a generative whole-brain model, fine-tuned on the basis of the effective connectivity. Given the biophysical limitations of direct electrical stimulation (DES) of microcircuits, this opens exciting possibilities for discovering stimulation targets and selecting connectivity patterns that can ensure propagation of DES-induced neural excitation, potentially making it possible to create awakenings from complex cases of brain injury.},

Patients with MDD aged {\textbackslash}geq 18 years, index date between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2015, no AD claims during baseline, and continuous enrollment in the database during baseline were included. Patients who started a third AD regimen after two regimens of appropriate duration were included in the TRD cohort. All-cause mortality was compared between patients with TRD and non-TRD MDD using a proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimate with TRD status being treated as a time-varying covariate. The model was adjusted for study year, age, gender, depression diagnosis, substance use disorder, psychiatric comorbidities, and Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: Out of 355,942 patients with MDD, 34,176 (9.6\%) met the criterion for TRD. TRD was associated with a significantly higher mortality compared with non-TRD MDD (adjusted HR: 1.29; 95\% CI 1.22-1.38; p {\textless} 0.0001). Survival time was significantly shorter in the TRD cohort compared with the non-TRD MDD cohort (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TRD had a higher all-cause mortality compared with non-TRD MDD patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of major depression have revealed resting-state abnormalities in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Recently, fMRI has been adapted to examine connectivity within a specific resting-state neural network–the default-mode network–that includes medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The goal of this study was to examine resting-state, default-mode network functional connectivity in subjects with major depression and in healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-eight subjects with major depression and 20 healthy controls underwent 5-min fMRI scans while resting quietly. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the default-mode network in each subject. Group maps of the default-mode network were compared. A within-group analysis was performed in the depressed group to explore effects of depression refractoriness on functional connectivity. RESULTS: Resting-state subgenual cingulate and thalamic functional connectivity with the default-mode network were significantly greater in the depressed subjects. Within the depressed group, the length of the current depressive episode correlated positively with functional connectivity in the subgenual cingulate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore default-mode functional connectivity in major depression. The findings provide cross-modality confirmation of PET studies demonstrating increased thalamic and subgenual cingulate activity in major depression. Further, the within-subject connectivity analysis employed here brings these previously isolated regions of hypermetabolism into the context of a disordered neural network. The correlation between refractoriness and subgenual cingulate functional connectivity within the network suggests that a quantitative, resting-state fMRI measure could be used to guide therapy in individual subjects.},

Research on the neurocircuitry of anxiety disorders has its roots in the study of fear circuits in animal models and the study of brain responses to emotional stimuli in healthy humans. We review this research, as well as neuroimaging studies of anxiety disorders. In general, these studies have reported relatively heightened amygdala activation in response to disorder-relevant stimuli in post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, and specific phobia. Activation in the insular cortex appears to be heightened in many of the anxiety disorders. Unlike other anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with diminished responsivity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent ventral medial prefrontal cortex. Additional research will be needed to (1) clarify the exact role of each component of the fear circuitry in the anxiety disorders, (2) determine whether functional abnormalities identified in the anxiety disorders represent acquired signs of the disorders or vulnerability factors that increase the risk of developing them, (3) link the findings of functional neuroimaging studies with those of neurochemistry studies, and (4) use functional neuroimaging to predict treatment response and assess treatment-related changes in brain function.},

	abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depression by evidence obtained using neuroimaging, neuropathologic, and lesion analysis techniques. The abnormalities revealed by these techniques show a regional specificity, and suggest that some OFC regions which appear cytoarchitectonically distinct also are functionally distinct with respect to mood regulation. For example, the severity of depression correlates inversely with physiological activity in parts of the posterior lateral and medial OFC, consistent with evidence that dysfunction of the OFC associated with cerebrovascular lesions increases the vulnerability for developing the major depressive syndrome. The posterior lateral and medial OFC function may also be impaired in individuals who develop primary mood disorders, as these patients show grey-matter volumetric reductions, histopathologic abnormalities, and altered hemodynamic responses to emotionally valenced stimuli, probabilistic reversal learning, and reward processing. In contrast, physiological activity in the anteromedial OFC situated in the ventromedial frontal polar cortex increases during the depressed versus the remitted phases of major depressive disorder to an extent that is positively correlated with the severity of depression. Effective antidepressant treatment is associated with a reduction in activity in this region. Taken together these data are compatible with evidence from studies in experimental animals indicating that some orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortex regions function to inhibit, while others function to enhance, emotional expression. Alterations in the functional balance between these regions and the circuits they form with anatomically related areas of the temporal lobe, striatum, thalamus, and brain stem thus may underlie the pathophysiology of mood disorders, such as major depression.},

	abstract = {The sleep-to-forget, sleep-to-remember (SFSR) hypothesis states that the neurobiological environment provided by rapid-eye movement (REM)-rich sleep decouples the content of an emotional memory from its attendant emotional arousal. This decoupling allows divergent attenuation and enhancement effects (i.e., erosion of the memory's emotional tone and simultaneous strengthening of its content). However, support for this proposal is mixed. An alternative account suggests there might be convergent attenuation and enhancement (i.e., elevated emotional arousal is positively coupled with enhanced emotional memory). We tested predictions emerging from the SFSR hypothesis using (a) individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; n = 21), (b) trauma-exposed non-PTSD individuals (n = 19), and (c) healthy controls (n = 20). We included PTSD-diagnosed individuals because they typically experience altered REM sleep, impaired emotional memory, and heightened emotional arousal in response to threatening stimuli. Participants were assessed before and after both an 8-h period of polysomnographically monitored sleep and an 8-h period of waking activity. The assessment included exposure to negatively valenced, positively valenced, and neutral pictures before the 8-h delay, and a recognition task afterward. We measured emotional arousal by recording psychophysiological responses to the pictures, both pre- and post-delay. Results indicated no significant between-group differences in emotional memory accuracy or arousal. However, after a sleep-filled delay, pictures of all categories were recognized with equal accuracy, whereas after a wake-filled delay, negative pictures were recognized preferentially. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that a sleep-filled delay was associated with attenuated emotional arousal to pictures of all categories, whereas a wake-filled delay was associated with a rise in emotional arousal across the day. Intriguingly, poorer recognition accuracy for valenced (but not neutral) pictures was predicted by an interaction of increased REM fragmentation and increased emotional arousal. In summary, we found some support for the SFSR hypothesis in the way it describes the REM- and arousal-based mechanisms that process emotional material. We also, however, found disconfirming evidence regarding the outcome of that process (i.e., sleep did not favor consolidation of emotional over neutral memory), and we demonstrated a convergence between attenuation of emotional arousal and weakening of emotional content relative to neutral content.},

	abstract = {Neural mass models (NMMs) are designed to reproduce the collective dynamics of neuronal populations. A common framework for NMMs assumes heuristically that the output firing rate of a neural population can be described by a static nonlinear transfer function (NMM1). However, a recent exact mean-field theory for quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons challenges this view by showing that the mean firing rate is not a static function of the neuronal state but follows two coupled nonlinear differential equations (NMM2). Here we analyze and compare these two descriptions in the presence of second-order synaptic dynamics. First, we derive the mathematical equivalence between the two models in the infinitely slow synapse limit, i.e., we show that NMM1 is an approximation of NMM2 in this regime. Next, we evaluate the applicability of this limit in the context of realistic physiological parameter values by analyzing the dynamics of models with inhibitory or excitatory synapses. We show that NMM1 fails to reproduce important dynamical features of the exact model, such as the self-sustained oscillations of an inhibitory interneuron QIF network. Furthermore, in the exact model but not in the limit one, stimulation of a pyramidal cell population induces resonant oscillatory activity whose peak frequency and amplitude increase with the self-coupling gain and the external excitatory input. This may play a role in the enhanced response of densely connected networks to weak uniform inputs, such as the electric fields produced by noninvasive brain stimulation.},

	volume = {28},
	copyright = {https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0},
	abstract = {This review considers computational psychiatry from a particular viewpoint: namely, a commitment to explaining psychopathology in terms of pathophysiology. It rests on the notion of a generative model as underwriting (i) sentient processing in the brain, and (ii) the scientific process in psychiatry. The story starts with a view of the brain-from cognitive and computational neuroscience-as an organ of inference and prediction. This offers a formal description of neuronal message passing, distributed processing and belief propagation in neuronal networks; and how certain kinds of dysconnection lead to aberrant belief updating and false inference. The dysconnections in question can be read as a pernicious synaptopathy that fits comfortably with formal notions of how we-or our brains-encode uncertainty or its complement, precision. It then considers how the ensuing process theories are tested empirically, with an emphasis on the computational modelling of neuronal circuits and synaptic gain control that mediates attentional set, active inference, learning and planning. The opportunities afforded by this sort of modelling are considered in light of in silico experiments; namely, computational neuropsychology, computational phenotyping and the promises of a computational nosology for psychiatry. The resulting survey of computational approaches is not scholarly or exhaustive. Rather, its aim is to review a theoretical narrative that is emerging across subdisciplines within psychiatry and empirical scales of investigation. These range from epilepsy research to neurodegenerative disorders; from post-traumatic stress disorder to the management of chronic pain, from schizophrenia to functional medical symptoms.},

	volume = {164},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study of human anxiety disorders has benefited greatly from functional neuroimaging approaches. Individual studies, however, vary greatly in their findings. The authors searched for common and disorder-specific functional neurobiological deficits in several anxiety disorders. The authors also compared these deficits to the neural systems engaged during anticipatory anxiety in healthy subjects. METHOD: Functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and fear conditioning in healthy individuals were compared by quantitative meta-analysis. Included studies compared negative emotional processing to baseline, neutral, or positive emotion conditions. RESULTS: Patients with any of the three disorders consistently showed greater activity than matched comparison subjects in the amygdala and insula, structures linked to negative emotional responses. A similar pattern was observed during fear conditioning in healthy subjects. Hyperactivation in the amygdala and insula were, of interest, more frequently observed in social anxiety disorder and specific phobia than in PTSD. By contrast, only patients with PTSD showed hypoactivation in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-structures linked to the experience and regulation of emotion. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis allowed us to synthesize often disparate findings from individual studies and thereby provide neuroimaging evidence for common brain mechanisms in anxiety disorders and normal fear. Effects unique to PTSD furthermore suggested a mechanism for the emotional dysregulation symptoms in PTSD that extend beyond an exaggerated fear response. Therefore, these findings help refine our understanding of anxiety disorders and their interrelationships.},

This study is part of an ambitious program towards computational personalization of neuromodulatory interventions in neuropsychiatry. We propose to model the individual human brain as a network of neural masses embedded in a realistic physical matrix capable of representing measurable electrical brain activity. We call this ahybrid brain model (HBM)to highlight that it encodes both biophysical and physiological characteristics of an individual brain. Although the framework is general, we provide here a pipeline for the integration of anatomical, structural and functional connectivity data obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse tensor imaging (DTIconnectome) and electroencephalography (EEG). We personalize model parameters through a comparison of simulated cortical functional connectivity with functional connectivity profiles derived from cortically-mapped, subject-specific EEG. We show that individual information can be represented in model space through the proper adjustment of two parameters (global coupling strength and conduction velocity), and that the underlying structural information has a strong impact on the functional outcome of the model. These findings provide a proof of concept and open the door for further advances, including the model-driven design of non-invasive brain-stimulation protocols.},

Using a systems neuroscience approach, this review synthesizes emerging perspectives on neurodevelopmental pathways of mathematical learning, highlighting the functional brain architecture that supports these processes and sources of heterogeneity in mathematical skill acquisition. We identify the core neural building blocks of numerical cognition, anchored in the posterior parietal and ventral temporal-occipital cortices, and describe how memory and cognitive control systems, anchored in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, help scaffold mathematical skill development. We highlight how interactive specialization of functional circuits influences mathematical learning across different stages of development. Functional and structural brain integrity and plasticity associated with math learning can be examined using an individual differences approach to better understand sources of heterogeneity in learning, including cognitive, affective, motivational, and sociocultural factors.

	volume = {142},
	copyright = {http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/},
	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that psilocybin with psychological support may be effective for treating depression. Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala responses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psychological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments' therapeutic actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to reconnect with their emotions.ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797.This article is part of the Special Issue entitled `Psychedelics: New Doors, Altered Perceptions'.},

	copyright = {http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serotonergic psychedelics, such as psilocybin, alter perceptual and cognitive systems that are functionally integrated with the amygdala. These changes can alter cognition and emotions that are hypothesized to contribute to their therapeutic utility. However, the neural mechanisms of cognitive and subcortical systems altered by psychedelics are not well understood. METHODS: We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance images collected during a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 24 healthy adults under 0.2 mg/kg psilocybin to estimate the directed (i.e., effective) changes between the amygdala and 3 large-scale resting-state networks involved in cognition. These networks are the default mode network, the salience network, and the central executive network. RESULTS: We found a pattern of decreased top-down effective connectivity from these resting-state networks to the amygdala. Effective connectivity decreased within the default mode network and salience network but increased within the central executive network. These changes in effective connectivity were statistically associated with behavioral measures of altered cognition and emotion under the influence of psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that temporary amygdala signal attenuation is associated with mechanistic changes to resting-state network connectivity. These changes are significant for altered cognition and perception and suggest targets for research investigating the efficacy of psychedelic therapy for internalizing psychiatric disorders. More broadly, our study suggests the value of quantifying the brain's hierarchical organization using effective connectivity to identify important mechanisms for basic cognitive function and how they are integrated to give rise to subjective experiences.},

Here, we examine psychedelic 5-HT2A/2C agonist, DOI, effects on dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, a region extensively linked to reward learning, motivation, and drug-seeking. We measure phasic dopamine transients following acute DOI administration in rats during well learned Pavlovian tasks in which sequential cues predict rewards. We find that DOI (0.0-1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) increases dopamine signals, photometrically measured using GRABDA optical sensor, to rewards and proximal reward cues, but not to the distal cues that predict these events. We determine that the elevated dopamine produced by DOI to reward cues occurs independently of DOI-induced changes in reward value. The increased dopamine associated with predictable reward cues and rewards supports DOI-induced increases in prediction error signaling. These findings lay a foundation for developing psychedelic strategies aimed at engaging error-driven learning mechanisms to disrupt entrenched associations or produce new associations.},

	title = {Serotonergic hallucinogens differentially modify gamma and high frequency oscillations in the rat nucleus accumbens},
	volume = {228},
	abstract = {RATIONALE: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a site critical for the actions of many drugs of abuse. Psychoactive compounds, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, modify gamma (40-90) and high frequency oscillations (HFO, 130-180 Hz) in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the NAc. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) are serotonergic hallucinogens and activation of 5HT2A receptors likely underlies their hallucinogenic effects. Whether these compounds can also modulate LFP oscillations in the NAc is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effect of serotonergic hallucinogens on gamma and HFO recorded in the NAc and to test whether 5HT2A receptors mediate the effects observed. METHODS: LFPs were recorded from the NAc of freely moving rats. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally. RESULTS: LSD (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and DOI (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) increased the power and reduced the frequency of HFO. In contrast, the hallucinogens produced a robust reduction in the power of low (40-60 Hz), but not high gamma oscillations (70-90 Hz). MDL 11939 (1.0 mg/kg), a 5HT2A receptor antagonist, fully reversed the changes induced by DOI on HFO but only partially for the low gamma band. Equivalent increases in HFO power were observed after TCB-2 (5HT2A receptor agonist, 0.1-1.5 mg/kg), but not CP 809101 (5H2C receptor agonist, 0.1-3 mg/kg). Notably, hallucinogen-induced increases in HFO power were smaller than those produced by ketamine (25 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogen-induced changes in HFO and gamma are mediated, at least in part, by stimulation of 5HT2A receptors. Comparison of the oscillatory changes produced by serotonergic hallucinogens and NMDAR antagonists are also discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of pharmacological trials that examine the neurocognitive effects of psychedelics among healthy individuals and patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) was used as a guide to structure and report the findings for this review. A literature search included the MEDLINE database up until December 2022. We included randomized or open-label human studies of MDMA, psilocybin, mescaline, LSD, DMT, or cannabis reporting non-emotionally charged neurocognitive outcomes (“cold cognition”) measured through validated neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: A total of 43 full-text papers on MDMA (15), cannabis (12), LSD (6), psilocybin (9), DMT/ayahuasca (1), and mescaline (0) were included, mostly on healthy subjects. A single article on MDMA's effects on cognition in subjects with PTSD was included; there were no studies on psychedelics and neurocognition in MDD. Most of the studies on healthy subjects reported detrimental or neutral effects on cognition during the peak effect of psychedelics with a few exceptions (e.g., MDMA improved psychomotor function). Performance on the type of neurocognitive dimension (e.g., attention, memory, executive function, psychomotor) varies by type of psychedelic, dosage, and cognitive testing. CONCLUSIONS: Small samples and a lack of uniformed methods across studies preclude unequivocal conclusions on whether psychedelics enhance, decrease, or have no significant effect on cognitive performance. It is foreseen that psychedelics will soon become an available treatment for various psychiatric disorders. The acute and long-term effects on cognition caused by psychedelics should be assessed in future studies.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Current treatment options for major depressive disorder (MDD) have limited efficacy and are associated with adverse effects. Recent studies investigating the antidepressant effect of serotonergic psychedelics-also known as classic psychedelics-have promising preliminary results with large effect sizes. In this context, we conducted a review of the putative neurobiological underpinnings of the mechanism of antidepressant action of these drugs. Methods: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed to identify published articles evaluating the antidepressant mechanism of action of serotonergic psychedelics. Results: Serotonergic psychedelics have serotonin (5HT)2A agonist or partial agonist effects. Their rapid antidepressant effects may be mediated-in part-by their potent 5HT2A agonism, leading to rapid receptor downregulation. In addition, these psychedelics impact brain derived neurotrophic factor and immunomodulatory responses, both of which may play a role in their antidepressant effect. Several neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies evaluating mechanistic change from a network perspective can help us to further understand their mechanism of action. Some, but not all, data suggest that psychedelics may exert their effects, in part, by disrupting the activity of the default mode network, which is involved in both introspection and self-referential thinking and is over-active in MDD. Conclusion: The mechanisms of action underlying the antidepressant effect of serotonergic psychedelics remains an active area of research. Several competing theories are being evaluated and more research is needed to determine which ones are supported by the most robust evidence.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {The modulating effects of serotonin on dopamine neurotransmission are not well understood, particularly in acute psychotic states. Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19\%) and putamen (20\%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses. The present results indirectly support the hypothesis of a serotonin-dopamine dysbalance in schizophrenia and suggest that psilocybin is a valuable tool in the analysis of serotonin-dopamine interactions in acute psychotic states.},

	abstract = {Depression is a growing public health concern, and exercise is an adjunctive treatment modality to improve depression, but the optimal form of exercise and the optimal dose are still unclear. This systematic review examined the efficacy of four major types of exercise (aerobic, resistance, mixed, and mind-body) on depression, as well as the dose-response relationship between total and specific exercise and depressive symptoms. We included randomized controlled trials that included participants aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder or a depressive symptom score above a threshold as determined by a validated screening measure, implemented one or more exercise therapy groups, and assessed depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up. Forty-six studies (3164 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Aerobic (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.93; 95\% CI: -1.25 to -0.62) and mind-body exercise (SMD) = -0.81; 95\% CI: -1.19 to -0.42) improved depressive symptoms better compared to controls, followed by mixed (SMD = -0.77; 95\% CI: -1.20 to -0.34) and resistance exercise (SMD = -0.76; 95\% CI: -1.24 to -0.28). This dose-response meta-analysis showed a U-shaped curve between exercise dose and depressive symptoms. The minimum effective dose was estimated to be 320 metabolic equivalent (METs) -min per week and the optimal response was 860 METs-min per week. These findings lead us to advocate that clinicians carefully select the appropriate dose of exercise based on the patient's individual characteristics and needs, in conjunction with psychological care interventions.},

	abstract = {Psilocin (3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-ol) is a hallucinogenic component of the Mexican mushroom Psilocybe mexicana and a skeletal serotonin (5-HT) analogue. Psilocin is the active metabolite of psilocybin (3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1H-indol-4-yl dihydrogen phosphate). In the present study, we examined the effects of systemically administered psilocin on extracellular dopamine and 5-HT concentrations in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex of the dopaminergic pathway in awake rats using in vivo microdialysis. Intraperitoneal administration of psilocin (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Psilocin did not affect the extracellular 5-HT level in the nucleus accumbens. Conversely, systemic administration of psilocin (10 mg/kg) significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats, but dopamine was decreased in this region. However, neither extracellular dopamine nor 5-HT levels in the VTA were altered by administration of psilocin. Behaviorally, psilocin significantly increased the number of head twitches. Thus, psilocin affects the dopaminergic system in the nucleus accumbens. In the serotonergic system, psilocin contribute to a crucial effect in the medial prefrontal cortex. The present data suggest that psilocin increased both the extracellular dopamine and 5-HT concentrations in the mesoaccumbens and/or mesocortical pathway.},

	abstract = {Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom-up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up versus down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bidirectional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among cross-frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up interactions made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low-frequency (theta, alpha, beta) and low-frequency-to-high- gamma couplings were predominant top-down, while low-frequency-to-low-gamma couplings were predominant bottom-up. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting that they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on gamma-rhythms in distant regions is important for bidirectional information transfer. The finding of low-frequency-to-low-gamma interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest that nonlinearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.},

	abstract = {Current concepts of sensory processing in the cerebral cortex emphasize serial extraction and recombination of features in hierarchically structured feed-forward networks in order to capture the relations among the components of perceptual objects. These concepts are implemented in convolutional deep learning networks and have been validated by the astounding similarities between the functional properties of artificial systems and their natural counterparts. However, cortical architectures also display an abundance of recurrent coupling within and between the layers of the processing hierarchy. This massive recurrence gives rise to highly complex dynamics whose putative function is poorly understood. Here a concept is proposed that assigns specific functions to the dynamics of cortical networks and combines, in a unifying approach, the respective advantages of recurrent and feed-forward processing. It is proposed that the priors about regularities of the world are stored in the weight distributions of feed-forward and recurrent connections and that the high-dimensional, dynamic space provided by recurrent interactions is exploited for computations. These comprise the ultrafast matching of sensory evidence with the priors covertly represented in the correlation structure of spontaneous activity and the context-dependent grouping of feature constellations characterizing natural objects. The concept posits that information is encoded not only in the discharge frequency of neurons but also in the precise timing relations among the discharges. Results of experiments designed to test the predictions derived from this concept support the hypothesis that cerebral cortex exploits the high-dimensional recurrent dynamics for computations serving predictive coding.},

	abstract = {Neural generative models can be used to learn complex probability distributions from data, to sample from them, and to produce probability density estimates. We propose a computational framework for developing neural generative models inspired by the theory of predictive processing in the brain. According to predictive processing theory, the neurons in the brain form a hierarchy in which neurons in one level form expectations about sensory inputs from another level. These neurons update their local models based on differences between their expectations and the observed signals. In a similar way, artificial neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring neurons will do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions matched reality. In this work, we show that the neural generative models learned within our framework perform well in practice across several benchmark datasets and metrics and either remain competitive with or significantly outperform other generative models with similar functionality (such as the variational auto-encoder)., Brain-inspired neural generative models can be designed to learn complex probability distributions from data. Here the authors propose a neural generative computational framework, inspired by the theory of predictive processing in the brain, that facilitates parallel computing for complex tasks.},

	abstract = {Considerable progress has recently been made in natural language processing: deep learning algorithms are increasingly able to generate, summarize, translate and classify texts. Yet, these language models still fail to match the language abilities of humans. Predictive coding theory offers a tentative explanation to this discrepancy: while language models are optimized to predict nearby words, the human brain would continuously predict a hierarchy of representations that spans multiple timescales. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the functional magnetic resonance imaging brain signals of 304 participants listening to short stories. First, we confirmed that the activations of modern language models linearly map onto the brain responses to speech. Second, we showed that enhancing these algorithms with predictions that span multiple timescales improves this brain mapping. Finally, we showed that these predictions are organized hierarchically: frontoparietal cortices predict higher-level, longer-range and more contextual representations than temporal cortices. Overall, these results strengthen the role of hierarchical predictive coding in language processing and illustrate how the synergy between neuroscience and artificial intelligence can unravel the computational bases of human cognition.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce a field of study that has emerged over the last decade, called Bayesian mechanics. Bayesian mechanics is a probabilistic mechanics, comprising tools that enable us to model systems endowed with a particular partition (i.e. into particles), where the internal states (or the trajectories of internal states) of a particular system encode the parameters of beliefs about external states (or their trajectories). These tools allow us to write down mechanical theories for systems that look as if they are estimating posterior probability distributions over the causes of their sensory states. This provides a formal language for modelling the constraints, forces, potentials and other quantities determining the dynamics of such systems, especially as they entail dynamics on a space of beliefs (i.e. on a statistical manifold). Here, we will review the state of the art in the literature on the free energy principle, distinguishing between three ways in which Bayesian mechanics has been applied to particular systems (i.e. path-tracking, mode-tracking and mode-matching). We go on to examine a duality between the free energy principle and the constrained maximum entropy principle, both of which lie at the heart of Bayesian mechanics, and discuss its implications.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits are composed of multiple regions, each with rich dynamics and engaging in communication with other regions. The combination of local, within-region dynamics and global, network-level dynamics is thought to provide computational flexibility. However, the nature of such multiregion dynamics and the underlying synaptic connectivity patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of recurrent neural networks with multiple interconnected regions. Within each region, neurons have a combination of random and structured recurrent connections. Motivated by experimental evidence of communication subspaces between cortical areas, these networks have low-rank connectivity between regions, enabling selective routing of activity. These networks exhibit two interacting forms of dynamics: high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between regions. To characterize this interaction, we develop a dynamical mean-field theory to analyze such networks in the limit where each region contains infinitely many neurons, with cross-region currents as key order parameters. Regions can act as both generators and transmitters of activity, roles that we show are in conflict. Specifically, taming the complexity of activity within a region is necessary for it to route signals to and from other regions. Unlike previous models of routing in neural circuits, which suppressed the activities of neuronal groups to control signal flow, routing in our model is achieved by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through a combination of connectivity structure and nonlinear recurrent dynamics. This theory provides insight into the interpretation of both multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.},

By analyzing which connections were modulated for optimal therapeutic response across these disorders, we segregate the frontal cortex into circuits that became dysfunctional in each of them. Dysfunctional circuits were topographically arranged from occipital to rostral, ranging from interconnections with sensorimotor cortices in dystonia, with the primary motor cortex in Tourette's syndrome, the supplementary motor area in Parkinson's disease, to ventromedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

	abstract = {Brain rhythms can facilitate neural communication for the maintenance of brain function. Beta rhythms (13–35 Hz) have been proposed to serve multiple domains of human ability, including motor control, cognition, memory and emotion, but the overarching organisational principles remain unknown. To uncover the circuit architecture of beta oscillations, we leverage normative brain data, analysing over 30 hours of invasive brain signals from 1772 cortical areas in epilepsy patients, to demonstrate that beta is the most distributed cortical brain rhythm. Next, we identify a shared brain network from beta dominant areas with deeper brain structures, like the basal ganglia, by mapping parametrised oscillatory peaks to whole-brain functional and structural MRI connectomes. Finally, we show that these networks share significant overlap with dopamine uptake as indicated by positron emission tomography. Our study suggests that beta oscillations emerge in cortico-subcortical brain networks that are modulated by dopamine. It provides the foundation for a unifying circuit-based conceptualisation of the functional role of beta activity beyond the motor domain and may inspire an extended investigation of beta activity as a feedback signal for closed-loop neurotherapies for dopaminergic disorders.},

However, relatively less attention has been paid to subcortical structures that may also contribute to body ownership perception, such as the cerebellum and putamen. Here, on the basis of neuroimaging and neuropsychological observations, we provide an overview of relevant subcortical regions and consider their potential role in generating and maintaining a sense of ownership over the body.

	abstract = {Brain stimulation is an increasingly popular neuromodulatory tool used in both clinical and research settings; however, the effects of brain stimulation, particularly those of non-invasive stimulation, are variable. This variability can be partially explained by an incomplete mechanistic understanding, coupled with a combinatorial explosion of possible stimulation parameters. Computational models constitute a useful tool to explore the vast sea of stimulation parameters and characterise their effects on brain activity. Yet the utility of modelling stimulation in-silico relies on its biophysical relevance, which needs to account for the dynamics of large and diverse neural populations and how underlying networks shape those collective dynamics. The large number of parameters to consider when constructing a model is no less than those needed to consider when planning empirical studies. This piece is centred on the application of phenomenological and biophysical models in non-invasive brain stimulation. We first introduce common forms of brain stimulation and computational models, and provide typical construction choices made when building phenomenological and biophysical models. Through the lens of four case studies, we provide an account of the questions these models can address, commonalities, and limitations across studies. We conclude by proposing future directions to fully realise the potential of computational models of brain stimulation for the design of personalized, efficient, and effective stimulation strategies.},

	abstract = {Context
Antidepressant medications represent the best established treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but there is little evidence that they have a specific pharmacological effect relative to pill-placebo for patients with less severe depression.

Objective
To estimate the relative benefit of medication vs placebo across a wide range of initial symptom severity in patients diagnosed with depression.

Data Sources
Pubmed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1980 through March 2009, along with references from meta-analyses and reviews.

Study Selection
Randomized placebo-controlled trials of FDA approved antidepressants in the treatment of Major or Minor Depressive Disorder were selected. Studies were included if their authors provided the requisite original data, they comprised adult outpatients, included a medication vs placebo comparison for at least 6 weeks, did not exclude patients on the basis of a placebo washout period, and utilized the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Data from six studies (718 patients) were included.

Data Extraction
Individual patient-level data were obtained from study authors.

Results
Medication vs placebo differences varied substantially as a function of baseline severity. Among patients with Hamilton scores below 23, Cohen’s d-type effect sizes for the difference between medication and placebo were estimated to be {\textless} .20 (a standard definition of a small effect). Estimates of the magnitude of the superiority of medication over placebo increased with increases in baseline Hamilton severity and crossed the NICE threshold for a clinically significant difference at a baseline score of 25.

Conclusions
The magnitude of benefit of antidepressant medication compared with placebo increases with severity of depression symptoms, and may be minimal or nonexistent, on average, in patients with mild or moderate symptoms. For patients with very severe depression, the benefit of medications over placebo is substantial.},

	abstract = {Introduction
The ability to deploy transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at home is a key usability advantage to support scaling for pivotal clinical trials. We have established a home-based tDCS protocol for use in clinical trials termed remotely supervised (RS)-tDCS.
Objective
To report the tolerability and feasibility of tDCS sessions completed to date using RS-tDCS in clinical trials.
Methods
We analyzed tolerability (i.e., adverse events, AEs) reported in six Class I/II/III trials using RS-tDCS to study symptom outcomes over 10 to 60 daily applications. Across the six clinical trials, 308 participants (18–78 years old) completed an average of 23 sessions for a total of 6779 RS-tDCS administrations. The majority of participants were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and open-label trials included those diagnosed with a range of other conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease, post-stroke aphasia, traumatic brain injury, cerebellar ataxia), with minimum-to-severe neurologic disability. Clinical trial feasibility (i.e., treatment fidelity and blinding integrity) was examined using two Class I randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
Results
No serious AEs occurred. Across administrations, three sessions (0.04\%) were aborted due to discomfort, but no participant discontinued due to tolerability. The AEs most commonly reported by participants were tingling (68\%), itching (41\%) and warmth sensation (42\%) at the electrode site, and these were equally reported in active and sham tDCS conditions. The two Class I RCTs resulted in rapid enrollment, high fidelity to treatment completion, and blinding integrity.
Conclusions
At-home RS-tDCS is tolerable, including when used over extended periods of time. Home-based RS-tDCS is feasible and can enable Class I tDCS clinical trial designs.},

It focuses specifically on two classical problems: reconstructing dynamical manifolds given partial measurements, which parallels modern latent variable methods, and inferring minimal dynamical motifs underlying complicated data sets, which mirrors interpretability probes for trained models. Generative machine\&nbsp;learning models seek to approximate and then sample the probability distribution of the data sets on which they are trained. This Perspective article connects these methods to historical studies of information processing and attractor geometry in nonlinear systems.},

	abstract = {Transcranial Direct brain stimulation (tDCS) is commonly used in order to modulate cortical networks activity during physiological processes through the application of weak electrical fields with scalp electrodes. Cathodal stimulation has been shown to decrease brain excitability in the context of epilepsy, with variable success. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the acute and the long-lasting effect of tDCS remain elusive. Using a novel approach of computational modeling that combines detailed but functionally integrated neurons we built a physiologically-based thalamocortical column. This model comprises 10,000 individual neurons made of pyramidal cells, and 3 types of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic cells (VIP, PV, and SST) respecting the anatomy, layers, projection, connectivity and neurites orientation. Simulating realistic electric fields in term of intensity, main results showed that 1) tDCS effects are best explained by modulation of the presynaptic probability of release 2) tDCS affects the dynamic of cortical network only if a sufficient number of neurons are modulated 3)VIP GABAergic interneurons of the superficial layer of the cortex are especially affected by tDCS 4) Long lasting effect depends on glutamatergic synaptic plasticity.},

Using simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI in subjects drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we developed a machine learning approach to investigate which brainwide fMRI dynamics predict alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) rhythms. We predicted moment-by-moment EEG power from fMRI activity in held-out subjects, and found that information about alpha power was represented by a remarkably small set of regions, segregated in two distinct networks linked to arousal and visual systems. Conversely, delta rhythms were diffusely represented on a large spatial scale across the cortex. These results identify distributed networks that predict delta and alpha rhythms, and establish a computational framework for investigating fMRI brainwide dynamics underlying EEG oscillations.},

	abstract = {Background: The relationship between COVID-19 infection and the increased likelihood of older adults developing new-onset dementia (NOD) remains elusive. This review primarily aimed to investigate the potential role of COVID-19 in leading to NOD among older adults aged 60 years and older over various time intervals.Methods: A thorough search was performed across several databases including MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, medRxiv, and PQDT Global for studies published in English from January 2020 to December 2023. We assessed the risk of developing NOD, using Risk Ratio (RR) for measurement. The control groups were categorized as: (i) a non-COVID cohort with other respiratory infections [control group (C1)]; and (ii) a non-COVID cohort with otherwise unspecified health statuses [control group (C2)]. Follow-up periods were divided into intervals of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-COVID. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023491714).Results: Our review incorporated 11 studies, encompassing 939,824 post-COVID-19 cases and 6,765,117 controls. The overall pooled analysis revealed a significant link between COVID-19 infection and an increased risk of NOD (RR = 1.58, 95\% CI 1.21–2.08). In subgroup analyses, NOD risk was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group compared to C2 at 12 months post-COVID (RR = 1.84, 95\% CI 1.41–2.38), but not at 3 (RR = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.46–1.65) or 6 months (RR = 1.73, 95\% CI 0.72–4.14). Compared to C1, the risk increase was not significantly remarkable at 3 (RR = 0.94, 95\% CI 0.35–2.57), 6 (RR = 1.13, 95\% CI 1.07–1.20), and 12 months (RR = 1.12, 95\% CI 0.91–1.38), and overall (RR = 1.13, 95\% CI 0.92–1.38). Female had a significantly higher risk of developing NOD in the COVID-positive group (RR = 1.65, 95\% CI 1.53–1.78) and C2 group (RR = 1.33, 95\% CI 1.22–1.44). Patients with severe COVID-19, as classified by the American Thoracic Society guidelines, were significantly much more prone to developing NOD than those with non-severe infections (RR = 17.58, 95\% CI 10.48–29.49). Cognitive impairment was nearly twice as likely in COVID-19 survivors compared to those uninfected (RR = 1.93, 95\% CI 1.52–2.43).Discussion: COVID-19 infection may be linked to a higher risk of NOD in recovered old adults at the subacute and chronic stages following COVID-19 diagnosis. This risk appears to be on par with that associated with other respiratory infections.Funding: None.Declaration of Interest: All authors declare no financial or non-financial conflicts of interest.},

	abstract = {Untreated depression is a growing public health concern, with patients often facing a prolonged trial-and-error process in search of effective treatment. Developing a predictive model for treatment response in clinical practice remains challenging.To establish a model based on electroencephalography (EEG) to predict response to 2 distinct selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications.This prognostic study developed a predictive model using EEG data collected between 2011 and 2017 from 2 independent cohorts of participants with depression: 1 from the first Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) group and the other from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) consortium. Eligible participants included those aged 18 to 65 years who had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Data were analyzed from January to December 2022.In an open-label trial, CAN-BIND participants received an 8-week treatment regimen of escitalopram treatment (10-20 mg), and EMBARC participants were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive an 8-week sertraline (50-200 mg) treatment or placebo treatment.The model’s performance was estimated using balanced accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. The model used data from the CAN-BIND cohort for internal validation, and data from the treatment group of the EMBARC cohort for external validation. At week 8, response to treatment was defined as a 50\% or greater reduction in the primary, clinician-rated scale of depression severity.The CAN-BIND cohort included 125 participants (mean [SD] age, 36.4 [13.0] years; 78 [62.4\%] women), and the EMBARC sertraline treatment group included 105 participants (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [13.8] years; 72 [68.6\%] women). The model achieved a balanced accuracy of 64.2\% (95\% CI, 55.8\%-72.6\%), sensitivity of 66.1\% (95\% CI, 53.7\%-78.5\%), and specificity of 62.3\% (95\% CI, 50.1\%-73.8\%) during internal validation with CAN-BIND. During external validation with EMBARC, the model achieved a balanced accuracy of 63.7\% (95\% CI, 54.5\%-72.8\%), sensitivity of 58.8\% (95\% CI, 45.3\%-72.3\%), and specificity of 68.5\% (95\% CI, 56.1\%-80.9\%). Additionally, the balanced accuracy for the EMBARC placebo group (118 participants) was 48.7\% (95\% CI, 39.3\%-58.0\%), the sensitivity was 50.0\% (95\% CI, 35.2\%-64.8\%), and the specificity was 47.3\% (95\% CI, 35.9\%-58.7\%), suggesting the model’s specificity in predicting SSRIs treatment response.In this prognostic study, an EEG-based model was developed and validated in 2 independent cohorts. The model showed promising accuracy in predicting treatment response to 2 distinct SSRIs, suggesting potential applications for personalized depression treatment.},

Here we propose a new framework for predictive coding called active predictive coding which can learn hierarchical world models and solve two radically different open problems in AI: (1) how do we learn compositional representations, e.g., part-whole hierarchies, for equivariant vision? and (2) how do we solve large-scale planning problems, which are hard for traditional reinforcement learning, by composing complex action sequences from primitive policies? Our approach exploits hypernetworks, self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to learn hierarchical world models that combine task-invariant state transition networks and task-dependent policy networks at multiple abstraction levels. We demonstrate the viability of our approach on a variety of vision datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, Omniglot) as well as on a scalable hierarchical planning problem. Our results represent, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a unified solution to the part-whole learning problem posed by Hinton, the nested reference frames problem posed by Hawkins, and the integrated state-action hierarchy learning problem in reinforcement learning.},

Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Drosophila melanogaster walking on a ball in a virtual reality arena to demonstrate that landmark-based orientation and angular path integration are combined in the population responses of neurons whose dendrites tile the ellipsoid body, a toroidal structure in the centre of the fly brain. The neural population encodes the fly's azimuth relative to its environment, tracking visual landmarks when available and relying on self-motion cues in darkness. When both visual and self-motion cues are absent, a representation of the animal's orientation is maintained in this network through persistent activity, a potential substrate for short-term memory. Several features of the population dynamics of these neurons and their circular anatomical arrangement are suggestive of ring attractors, network structures that have been proposed to support the function of navigational brain circuits.},

In a semi-intact rat brain preparation, vascular pressure pulsations elicited correlated local field oscillations in the olfactory bulb mitral cell layer. These oscillations did not require synaptic transmission but reflected baroreceptive transduction in mitral cells. This transduction was mediated by a fast excitatory mechanosensitive ion channel and modulated neuronal spiking activity. In awake animals, the heartbeat entrained the activity of a subset of olfactory bulb neurons within {\textasciitilde}20 milliseconds. Thus, we propose that this fast, intrinsic interoceptive mechanism can modulate perception—for example, during arousal—within the olfactory bulb and possibly across various other brain areas.},

Gamma oscillations (30 to 80 hertz), a biomarker of cognitive performance, require and potentiate glutamatergic transmission onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVIs), suggesting an interface for cell-to-network plasticity. In ex vivo local field potential recordings, we demonstrate long-term potentiation of hippocampal gamma power. Gamma potentiation obeys established rules of PVI plasticity, requiring calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). A microcircuit computational model of CA3 gamma oscillations predicts CP-AMPAR plasticity onto PVIs critically outperforms pyramidal cell plasticity in increasing gamma power and completely accounts for gamma potentiation. We reaffirm this ex vivo in three PVI-targeting animal models, demonstrating that gamma potentiation requires PVI-specific signaling via a Gq/PKC pathway comprising mGluR5 and a Gi-sensitive, PKA-dependent pathway. Gamma activity–dependent, metabotropically mediated CP-AMPAR plasticity on PVIs may serve as a guiding principle in understanding network plasticity in health and disease.},

As an alternative, self-supervised learning attracts many researchers for its soaring performance on representation learning in the last several years. Self-supervised representation learning leverages input data itself as supervision and benefits almost all types of downstream tasks. In this survey, we take a look into new self-supervised learning methods for representation in computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning. We comprehensively review the existing empirical methods and summarize them into three main categories according to their objectives: generative, contrastive, and generative-contrastive (adversarial). We further investigate related theoretical analysis work to provide deeper thoughts on how self-supervised learning works. Finally, we briefly discuss open problems and future directions for self-supervised learning. An outline slide for the survey is provided.},

	url = {https://osf.io/zpf9c},
	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/zpf9c},
	abstract = {Importance: Antidepressant discontinuation substantially increases the risk of a depression relapse. The neurobiological mechanisms through which this happens are not known. Amygdala reactivity to negative information is a marker of negative affective processes in depression that is reduced by antidepressant medication. However, it is unknown whether amygdala reactivity is sensitive to antidepressant discontinuation, and whether any change is related to the risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation.

Objective: To investigate whether amygdala reactivity to negative facial emotions changes with antidepressant discontinuation and relates to subsequent relapse.

Design: The AIDA study was a longitudinal, observational AIDA study, where patients were randomized to task-based fMRI measurement of amygdala reactivity either twice before, or after discontinuing antidepressants. Relapse was monitored over a six month follow-up period. Study recruitment took place until January 2018. Data were collected between July 1, 2015, to January 31, 2019 and statistical analyses were conducted between June 2021 and December 2023.

Setting:University setting in Zurich, Switzerland, and Berlin, Germany.

Participants:Patients with remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) on antidepressants. Of 123 recruited patients, 80 (mean (SD) age 35.5 (11.4) years; 60 women (75\%) were included in analyses. Of 66 recruited healthy controls matched for age, sex, and education, 53 were included in analyses (mean (SD) age 34.9 (10.7) years); 37 women (70\%)).

Exposure:Discontinuation of antidepressant medication.

Outcomes:Task-based fMRI measurement of amygdala reactivity and MDD relapse within 6 months after discontinuation.

Results: Amygdala reactivity of rMDD patients on medication did not differ from controls (left: t=0.77, p=0.44, right: t=0.88, p=0.37). An increase in amygdala reactivity after antidepressant discontinuation was associated with depression relapse (three-way interaction between group (continuation vs discontinuation), time point and relapse; beta=25.1, 95\%-CI (4.4,45.8), p=0.018). Amygdala reactivity change was associated with shorter times to relapse (hazard ratio 1.05, 95\%-CI (1.016,1.085)), and predictive of relapse (LOOCV balanced accuracy 71\%, 95\%-PPI (57\%,84\%)).

Conclusions and Relevance:An increase in amygdala reactivity is associated with risk of relapse after antidepressant discontinuation and may represent a functional neuroimaging marker that could inform clinical decisions around antidepressant discontinuation.},

METHODS: We used data (n = 55) from our recent double-blind, parallel-group, randomized head-to-head comparison trial of escitalopram and investigational drug, COMP360, psilocybin. Mixed linear models were used to investigate the association between pre-treatment efficacy-related expectations, as well as baseline trait suggestibility and absorption, and therapeutic response to both escitalopram and COMP360 psilocybin.
RESULTS: Patients had significantly higher expectancy for psilocybin relative to escitalopram; however, expectancy for escitalopram was associated with improved therapeutic outcomes to escitalopram, expectancy for psilocybin was not predictive of response to psilocybin. Separately, we found that pre-treatment trait suggestibility was associated with therapeutic response in the psilocybin arm, but not in the escitalopram arm.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that psychedelic therapy may be less vulnerable to expectancy biases than previously suspected. The relationship between baseline trait suggestibility and response to psilocybin therapy implies that highly suggestible individuals may be primed for response to this treatment.},

All randomized controlled clinical trials that studied the effects of tDCS in at least one of the following outcomes: appetite, body weight changes, food intake, and food craving in adults with overweight or obesity, were included.Results: Fourteen studies were identified. Of those, six analyzed appetite, nine analyzed food intake, five analyzed food craving, and six analyzed body weight changes. All the studies considered the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as a target. The results reinforce the safety of this technique and point to a positive effect of the association of tDCS with other strategies for the management of obesity. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of understanding individual variability to promote beneficial results.Conclusions: This systematic review shows promising results regarding the use of tDCS in the treatment of obesity. However, the current literature is still controversial and differs between the tDCS protocols and the methods for evaluating the analyzed outcomes. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of action and individual effects of tDCS in people with obesity to enable its use in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Several studies demonstrated non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are safe and simple techniques that can reduce body weight, food cravings, and food consumption in patients with obesity. However, a systematic to evaluate the efficacy of active NIBS versus sham stimulation in reducing body weight and food cravings in patients with obesity is not available. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Control Trial between January 1990 and February 2022. Mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome variables with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were used to examine the effects of NIBS on body weight and body mass index (BMI), whereas the hedges's g test was used to measure the effects on food craving. Nineteen RCTs involving 571 participants were included in this study. Active neurostimulation (TMS and tDCS) was significantly more likely than sham stimulation to reduce body weight (TMS: −3.29 kg, 95\% CI [−5.32, −1.26]; I2 = 48\%; p {\textless} .001; tDCS: −0.82 kg, 95\% CI [−1.01, −0.62]; I2 = 0.0\%; p = .00) and BMI (TMS: −0.74, 95\% CI [−1.17, −0.31]; I2 = 0\% p = .00; tDCS: MD = −0.55, 95\% CI [−2.32, 1.21]; I2 = 0\% p = .54) as well as food cravings (TMS: g = −0.91, 95\% CI [−1.68, −0.14]; I2 = 88 p = .00; tDCS: g = −0.32, 95\% CI [−0.62, −0.02]; p = .04). Compared with sham stimulation, our findings indicate that active NIBS can significantly help to reduce body weight and food cravings.

We performed semi-structured interviews, neurological examinations, 3T-MRI scans, and neuropsychological assessments. For MRI analyses, we included a group of non-infected 77 controls. The MRI study included white matter (WM) investigation with diffusion tensor images (DTI) and functional connectivity with resting-state functional MRI (RS-fMRI). The patients reported memory loss (36\%), fatigue (31\%) and headache (29\%). The quantitative analyses confirmed symptoms of fatigue (83\% of participants), excessive somnolence (35\%), impaired phonemic verbal fluency (21\%), impaired verbal categorical fluency (13\%) and impaired logical memory immediate recall (16\%). The WM analyses with DTI revealed higher axial diffusivity values in post-infected patients compared to controls. Compared to controls, there were no significant differences in the functional connectivity of the posterior cingulum cortex. There were no significant correlations between neuropsychological scores and neuroimaging features (including DTI and RS-fMRI). Our results suggest persistent cognitive impairment and subtle white matter abnormalities in individuals mildly infected without anxiety or depression symptoms. The longitudinal analyses will clarify whether these alterations are temporary or permanent.},

	abstract = {The connections in networks of neurons are heavy-tailed, with a small number of neurons connected much more strongly than the vast majority of pairs. However, it remains unclear whether this heavy-tailed connectivity emerges from simple underlying mechanisms. Here we propose a minimal model of synaptic self-organization: connections are pruned at random, and the synaptic strength rearranges under a mixture of preferential and random dynamics. Under these generic rules, networks evolve to produce distributions of connectivity strength that are asymptotically scale-free, with a power-law exponent that depends only on the probability of preferential (rather than random) growth. Extending our model to include neuronal activity and Hebbian plasticity, we find that clustering in the network also emerges naturally. We confirm these predictions in the connectomes of several animals, suggesting that heavy-tailed and clustered connectivity may arise from general principles of network self-organization rather than mechanisms specific to individual species or systems.},

	abstract = {How rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs), such as ketamine, induce immediate and sustained improvements in mood in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is poorly understood. A core feature of MDD is the prevalence of cognitive processing biases associated with negative affective states, and the alleviation of negative affective biases may be an index of response to drug treatment. Here, we used an affective bias behavioral test in rats, based on an associative learning task, to investigate the effects of RAADs. To generate an affective bias, animals learned to associate two different digging substrates with a food reward in the presence or absence of an affective state manipulation. A choice between the two reward-associated digging substrates was used to quantify the affective bias generated. Acute treatment with the RAADs ketamine, scopolamine, or psilocybin selectively attenuated a negative affective bias in the affective bias test. Low, but not high, doses of ketamine and psilocybin reversed the valence of the negative affective bias 24 hours after RAAD treatment. Only treatment with psilocybin, but not ketamine or scopolamine, led to a positive affective bias that was dependent on new learning and memory formation. The relearning effects of ketamine were dependent on protein synthesis localized to the rat medial prefrontal cortex and could be modulated by cue reactivation, consistent with experience-dependent neural plasticity. These findings suggest a neuropsychological mechanism that may explain both the acute and sustained effects of RAADs, potentially linking their effects on neural plasticity with affective bias modulation in a rodent model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychedelic therapy shows promise for Major Depressive Disorder, especially when treatment-resistant, as well as life-threatening illness distress. The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms.
METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials.
RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5 weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8 weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive.
LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review.
CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results. This suggests the need for more randomised clinical trials of psychedelic therapy, with larger and more diverse samples.},

Aims: This study sought to examine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin through 12 months in participants with moderate to severe MDD who received psilocybin.
Methods: This randomized, waiting-list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21–75 with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) ⩾ 17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received two doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty-four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose.
Results: All 24 participants attended all follow-up visits through the 12-month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID-HAMD scores were observed at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (⩾50\% reduction in GRID-HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75\% and 58\%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long-term follow-up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after sessions predicted increased well-being at 12 months, but did not predict improvement in depression.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in higher brain functions altered in schizophrenia. Classical antipsychotic drugs modulate information processing in cortico-limbic circuits via dopamine D2 receptor blockade in nucleus accumbens (NAc) whereas atypical antipsychotic drugs preferentially target cortical serotonin (5-HT) receptors. The brain networks involved in the therapeutic action of atypical drugs are not fully understood. Previous work indicated that medial PFC (mPFC) pyramidal neurons projecting to ventral tegmental area express 5-HT2A receptors suggesting that atypical antipsychotic drugs modulate dopaminergic activity distally, via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2A-R) blockade in PFC. Since the mPFC also projects heavily to NAc, we examined whether NAc-projecting pyramidal neurons also express 5-HT2A-R. Using a combination of retrograde tracing experiments and in situ hybridization we report that a substantial proportion of mPFC-NAc pyramidal neurons in rat brain express 5-HT2A-R mRNA in a layer- and area-specific manner (up to 68\% in layer V of contralateral cingulate). The functional relevance of 5-HT2A-R to modulate mPFC-NAc projections was examined in dual-probe microdialysis experiments. The application of the preferential 5-HT2A-R agonist DOI into mPFC enhanced glutamate release locally (+66 ± 18\%) and in NAc (+74 ± 12\%) indicating that cortical 5-HT2A-R activation augments glutamatergic transmission in NAc. Since NAc integrates glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, blockade of 5-HT2A-R by atypical drugs may reduce cortical excitatory inputs onto GABAergic neurons of NAc, adding to dopamine D2 receptor blockade. Together with previous observations, the present results suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs may control the activity of the mesolimbic pathway at cell body and terminal level.},

Then, we employ this framework to infer the location of oscillatory generators from laminar-resolved data collected from the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. We define a minimal model capable of generating coupled slow and fast oscillations, and we optimize LaNMM-specific parameters to fit multi-contact recordings. We rank the candidate models using an optimization function that evaluates the match between the functional connectivity (FC) of the model and data, where FC is defined by the covariance between bipolar voltage measurements at different cortical depths. The family of best solutions reproduces the FC of the observed electrophysiology by selecting locations of pyramidal cells and their synapses that result in the generation of fast activity at superficial layers and slow activity across most depths, in line with recent literature proposals. In closing, we discuss how this hybrid modeling framework can be more generally used to infer cortical circuitry.},

High plasticity has been associated with high susceptibility to contextual factors, for example, living conditions, which ultimately drive the plasticity outcome. Here we exploited network analysis to show that plasticity—in this case, the susceptibility to modify the depression score—can be measured by assessing the symptom network connectivity: the weaker the connectivity, the higher the plasticity, resulting in a greater modification in mood symptoms. We analyzed the STAR*D dataset and found that baseline connectivity strength was weaker in responder patients than non-responder patients. Moreover, connectivity strength was inversely correlated with improvement in depression score (ρ = –0.88, P = 0.002) and susceptibility to change mood according to context (ρ = 0.78, P = 0.028). This operationalization of plasticity provides a mathematical tool to predict resilience, vulnerability and recovery, and to develop novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of major depressive disorder.},

	abstract = {Introduction (Background)Depression is an often chronic condition, characterized by wide-ranging physical, cognitive and psychosocial symptoms that can lead to disability, premature mortality or suicide. It affects 350 million people globally, yet up to 30\% do not respond to traditional treatment, creating an urgent need for novel non-pharmacological treatments. This open-label naturalistic study assesses the practical feasibility, tolerability, and clinical effectiveness of home-administered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with asynchronous remote supervision, in the treatment of depression.MethodOver the course of 3 weeks, 40 patients with depression received psychotherapy and half of this group also received daily bi-frontal tDCS stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These patients received tDCS for 30 min per session with the anode placed over F3 and the cathode over F4, at an intensity of 2 mA for 21 consecutive days. We measured patients' level of depression symptoms at four time points using the Beck Depression Inventory, before treatment and at 1-week intervals throughout the treatment period. We monitored practical feasibility such as daily protocol compliance and tolerability including side effects, with the PlatoScience cloud-based remote supervision platform.ResultsOf the 20 patients in the tDCS group, 90\% were able to comply with the protocol by not missing more than three of their assigned sessions, and none dropped out of the study. No serious adverse events were reported, with only 14 instances of mild to moderate side effects and two instances of scalp pain rated as severe, out of a total of 420 stimulation sessions. Patients in the tDCS group showed a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms after 3 weeks of treatment, compared to the treatment as usual (TAU) group [t(57.2) = 2.268, p = 0.027]. The tDCS group also showed greater treatment response (50\%) and depression remission rates (75\%) compared to the TAU group (5 and 30\%, respectively).Discussion (Conclusion)These findings provide a possible indication of the clinical effectiveness of home-administered tDCS for the treatment of depression, and its feasibility and tolerability in combination with asynchronous supervision.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A single session of anodal tDCS induces LTP-like plasticity which lasts for about 1 h, while repetition of stimulation within a time interval of 30 min results in late-phase effects lasting for at least 24 h with standard stimulation protocols.
OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we explored if the after-effects of a recently developed intensified single session stimulation protocol are relevantly prolonged in the motor cortex by repetition of this intervention.
METHODS: 16 healthy right-handed subjects participated in this study. The effects of an intensified (3 mA-20min) and a standard anodal tDCS protocol (1 mA-15min) with short (20 min) and long (3 h) repetition intervals were compared with the effects of respective single session tDCS protocols (3 mA-20min, 1 mA-15min, and Sham). Cortical excitability alterations were monitored by single-pulse TMS-elicited MEPs.
RESULTS: Compared to sham, both single session tDCS protocols (1 mA-15min, and 3 mA-20min) resulted in cortical excitability enhancements lasting for about 30 min after stimulation. The short repetition interval (20 min) resulted in a prolongation of after-effects for the standard protocol, which lasted for more than 24 h after stimulation. For the intensified protocol, the prolongation of after-effects was limited to 120 min after stimulation. The long repetition interval (3 h) resulted in no excitability-enhancing after-effects for the intensified, and only minor excitability enhancement within the first 30 min after the intervention for the standard protocol.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest a non-linearity of late-phase LTP-like plasticity induction, which was dependent not only on the interval of intervention repetition, but also on other protocol characteristics, including intensity, and duration of tDCS. Further studies in larger samples are needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique (NIBS) that has been proven to promote beneficial effects in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, although has been widely investigated, the mechanism comprehension around tDCS effects presents still some gaps. Therefore, scientists are still trying to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind its positive effects to permit a more suitable application. Experimental models have provided converging evidence that tDCS elicits improvements in learning and memory by modulating both excitability and synaptic plasticity in neurons. Recently, among tDCS neurobiological effects, neural synchronization and dendritic structural changes have been reported in physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting possible effects at the neuronal circuit level. In this review, we bring in to focus the emerging effects of tDCS on the structural plasticity changes and neuronal rewiring, with the intent to match these two aspects with the underpinning molecular mechanisms identified so far, providing a new perspective to work on to unveil novel tDCS therapeutic use to treat brain dysfunctions.},

In particular, the long-lasting miniatured power sources that can supply energy continually to power handheld gadgets, sensors, electronic devices, unmanned airborne vehicles in space and extreme mining are some of the examples where this is an acute need. It is known from basic physics that radioactive materials decay over few years and some nuclear materials have their half-life until thousands of years. The past five decades of research have been spent harnessing the decay energy of the radioactive materials to develop batteries that can last until the radioactive reaction continues. Thus, an emergent opportunity of industrial symbiosis to make use of nuclear waste by using radioactive waste as raw material to develop batteries with long shelf life presents a great opportunity for sustainable energy resource development. However, the current canon of research on this topic is scarce. This perspective draws fresh discussions on the topic while highlighting future directions in this wealthy arena of research.},

Lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked (LCINS) is estimated to be the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2023, preferentially occurring in women and Asian populations. As smoking rates continue to decline, understanding the aetiology and features of this disease, which necessitate unique diagnostic and treatment paradigms, will be imperative. New data have provided important insights into the molecular and genomic characteristics of LCINS, which are distinct from those of smoking-associated lung cancers and directly affect treatment decisions and outcomes. Herein, we review the emerging data regarding the aetiology and features of LCINS, particularly the genetic and environmental underpinnings of this disease as well as their implications for treatment. In addition, we outline the unique diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms of LCINS and discuss future directions in identifying individuals at high risk of this disease for potential screening efforts.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with widespread subtle neuroanatomical correlates. Our objective was to identify the neuroanatomical dimensions that characterize MDD and predict treatment response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants or placebo. In the COORDINATE-MDD consortium, raw MRI data were shared from international samples (N = 1,384) of medication-free individuals with first-episode and recurrent MDD (N = 685) in a current depressive episode of at least moderate severity, but not treatment-resistant depression, as well as healthy controls (N = 699). Prospective longitudinal data on treatment response were available for a subset of MDD individuals (N = 359). Treatments were either SSRI antidepressant medication (escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline) or placebo. Multi-center MRI data were harmonized, and HYDRA, a semi-supervised machine-learning clustering algorithm, was utilized to identify patterns in regional brain volumes that are associated with disease. MDD was optimally characterized by two neuroanatomical dimensions that exhibited distinct treatment responses to placebo and SSRI antidepressant medications. Dimension 1 was characterized by preserved gray and white matter (N = 290 MDD), whereas Dimension 2 was characterized by widespread subtle reductions in gray and white matter (N = 395 MDD) relative to healthy controls. Although there were no significant differences in age of onset, years of illness, number of episodes, or duration of current episode between dimensions, there was a significant interaction effect between dimensions and treatment response. Dimension 1 showed a significant improvement in depressive symptoms following treatment with SSRI medication (51.1\%) but limited changes following placebo (28.6\%). By contrast, Dimension 2 showed comparable improvements to either SSRI (46.9\%) or placebo (42.2\%) (β = –18.3, 95\% CI (–34.3 to –2.3), P = 0.03). Findings from this case-control study indicate that neuroimaging-based markers can help identify the disease-based dimensions that constitute MDD and predict treatment response.},

Normative models indicated that person-specific deviations from population expectations for regional GMV were highly heterogeneous, affecting the same area in {\textless}7\% of people with the same diagnosis. However, these deviations were embedded within common functional circuits and networks in up to 56\% of cases. The salience–ventral attention system was implicated transdiagnostically, with other systems selectively involved in depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Phenotypic differences between cases assigned the same diagnosis may thus arise from the heterogeneous localization of specific regional deviations, whereas phenotypic similarities may be attributable to the dysfunction of common functional circuits and networks.},

The 5-HT regulation of the gene transcription factor IEG, c-fos, involves activation of 5-HT2A and ionotropic glutamate receptors. Here, we investigate whether these receptors are also involved in the regulation of the effector IEG, Arc. In rats, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI induced a marked increase in expression of Arc mRNA in a variety of cortical regions. This effect was blocked by the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, MDL 100,907, but not the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist, SB206553. The AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 also attenuated DOI-induced Arc mRNA expression, as did the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 in some regions. Immunofluorescence studies showed that DOI increased Arc-immunoreactivity in cortical cells that expressed AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits but not the 5-HT2A receptor. Finally, DOI-induced Arc-immunoreactivity in cortical cells was extensively co-localised with c-fos-immunoreactivity. These results suggest that, as with c-fos expression, ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA and NMDA) are involved in 5-HT2A receptor-induced Arc expression. This finding, together with evidence of extensive Arc and c-fos co-localisation, suggests that 5-HT2A receptor activation may induce the expression of both effector and transcription factor IEGs via common molecular and cellular substrates.},

	abstract = {Psychosis occurs across a wide variety of dementias with differing etiologies, including Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) inverse agonist, has shown promising results in clinical trials by reducing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions and the risk of relapse of these symptoms in patients with dementia-related psychosis. A literature review was conducted to identify mechanisms that explain the role of 5-HT2ARs in both the etiology and treatment of dementia-related psychosis. This review revealed that most pathological changes commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases cause one or more of the following events to occur: reduced synaptic contact of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons with glutamatergic pyramidal cells, reduced cortical innervation from subcortical structures, and altered 5-HT2AR expression levels. Each of these events promotes increased pyramidal cell hyperexcitability and disruption of excitatory/inhibitory balance, facilitating emergence of psychotic behaviors. The brain regions affected by these pathological changes largely coincide with areas expressing high levels of 5-HT2ARs. At the cellular level, 5-HT2ARs are most highly expressed on cortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells, where they regulate pyramidal cell excitability. The common effects of different neurodegenerative diseases on pyramidal cell excitability together with the close anatomical and functional connection of 5-HT2ARs to pyramidal cell excitability may explain why suppressing 5-HT2AR activity could be an effective strategy to treat dementia-related psychosis.},

excitatory-inhibitory balance in these circuits and can participate in
neuroplasticity within brain structures critical for the integration of

Using this tool, we show evidence that neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence quotient scores are closer to a critical state, i.e., the boundary between the paramagnetic phase and the spin-glass (SG) phase.

This focus on causation makes sense, because causal information can provide explanations of brain function and identify reliable targets with which to understand cognitive function and prevent or change neurological conditions and psychiatric disorders. In this research, one of the most frequently used causal concepts is ‘mechanism’ — this is seen in the literature and language of the field, in grant and funding inquiries that specify what research is supported, and in journal guidelines on which contributions are considered for publication. In these contexts, mechanisms are commonly tied to expressions of the main aims of the field and cited as the ‘fundamental’, ‘foundational’ and/or ‘basic’ unit for understanding the brain. Despite its common usage and perceived importance, mechanism is used in different ways that are rarely distinguished. Given that this concept is defined in different ways throughout the field — and that there is often no clarification of which definition is intended — there remains a marked ambiguity about the fundamental goals, orientation and principles of the field.

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental disorder with a high disability rate worldwide. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most common agents for antidepressant use. SSRIs and SNRIs are believed to achieve antidepressant effects through the activation of serotonergic or noradrenergic systems. However, whether the dopaminergic system is involved remains unclear. In our study, a genetically encoded dopamine sensor and in vivo fiber photometry recordings were used to measure the dopamine concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) after acute intraperitoneal injection of SSRIs or SNRIs. Combined with the behavioral tests, we found that SNRIs increased dopamine concentrations in both the mPFC and the NAc and showed faster antidepressant effects than SSRIs. To verify the enhanced dopamine levels induce the faster antidepressant effects of SNRIs, we employed dopamine receptor antagonists to specifically block the dopaminergic function. The results showed that the faster antidepressant effects of SNRIs were weakened by the dopamine receptor antagonists. Altogether, our study reveals that SNRIs achieve faster antidepressant effects than SSRIs by elevating the dopamine concentrations in the mPFC and the NAc. Our work proposes further mechanisms for the first-line antidepressants, which provides more basis for clinical treatments.

	abstract = {A growing number of research publications have illustrated the remarkable ability of the brain to reorganize itself in response to various sensory experiences. A traditional view of this plastic nature of the brain is that it is predominantly limited to short epochs during early development. Although examples showing that neuroplasticity exists outside of these finite time-windows have existed for some time, it is only recently that we have started to develop a fuller understanding of the different regulators that modulate and underlie plasticity. In this article, we will provide several lines of evidence indicating that mechanisms of neuroplasticity are extremely variable across individuals and throughout the lifetime. This variability is attributable to several factors including inhibitory network function, neuromodulator systems, age, sex, brain disease, and psychological traits. We will also provide evidence of how neuroplasticity can be manipulated in both the healthy and diseased brain, including recent data in both young and aged rats demonstrating how plasticity within auditory cortex can be manipulated pharmacologically and by varying the quality of sensory inputs. We propose that a better understanding of the individual differences that exist within the various mechanisms that govern experience-dependent neuroplasticity will improve our ability to harness brain plasticity for the development of personalized translational strategies for learning and recovery following brain injury or disease.},

	abstract = {Understanding the pathophysiological dynamics which underline interictal epileptiform events (IEEs) such as epileptic spikes, spike-and-waves or High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is of major importance in the context of neocortical refractory epilepsy, as it paves the way for the development of novel therapies. Typically, these events are detected in local field potential (LFP) recordings obtained through depth electrodes during pre-surgical investigations. Although essential, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the generation of these epileptic neuromarkers remain unclear. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel neurophysiologically relevant reconstruction of the neocortical microcircuitry in the context of epilepsy. This reconstruction intends to facilitate the analysis of a comprehensive set of parameters encompassing physiological, morphological, and biophysical aspects that directly impact the generation and recording of different IEEs. Accordingly, a novel microscale computational model of an epileptic neocortical column was introduced. This model incorporates the intricate multilayered structure of the cortex and allows for the simulation of realistic interictal epileptic signals. The proposed model was validated through comparisons with real IEEs recorded using intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) signals from both humans and animals. Using the model, the user can recreate epileptiform patterns observed in different species (human, rodent, and mouse) and study the intracellular activity associated with these patterns. Our model allowed us to unravel the relationship between glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission of the epileptic neural network and the type of generated IEE. Moreover, sensitivity analyses allowed for the exploration of the pathophysiological parameters responsible for the transitions between these events. Finally, the presented modeling framework also provides an Electrode Tissue Model (ETI) that adds realism to the simulated signals and offers the possibility of studying their sensitivity to the electrode characteristics. The model (NeoCoMM) presented in this work can be of great use in different applications since it offers an in silico framework for sensitivity analysis and hypothesis testing. It can also be used as a starting point for more complex studies.},

Rev. Neurosci. 10, 186–198. (doi:10.1038/nrn2618)). Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g. degree-distribution, node centrality and modularity. Here, we study the characteristics of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections. This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects—homological cycles—associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network and simultaneously make their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare resting-state functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of placebo and psilocybin—the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results show that the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo.},

On the other hand, Cartier and DeWitt-Morette have given a rigorous definition for quantum field theories (qfts) by means of path integrals. This article uses their results to study whether qfts can be made compatible with topology changes. We show that path integrals over metrics need a finite norm for the latter and for degenerate metrics, this problem can sometimes be resolved with tetrads. We prove that already in the neighborhood of some cuspidal singularities, difficulties can arise to define certain qfts. On the other hand, we show that simple qfts can be defined around conical singularities that result from a topology change in a simple setup. We argue that the ground state of many theories of quantum gravity will imply a small cosmological constant and, during the expansion of the universe, will cause frequent topology changes. Unfortunately, it is difficult to describe the transition amplitudes consistently due to the aforementioned problems. We argue that one needs to describe qfts by stochastic differential equations, and in the case of gravity, by Regge calculus in order to resolve this problem.},

	abstract = {It is well known that life on Earth alters its environment over evolutionary and geological timescales. An important open question is whether this is a result of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the latter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in environmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in which replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the recycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic, first-order phase transition from nonlife to life, where the life phase is distinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling plays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition corresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment, driven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity as replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual information shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of successfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete, leading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges. Often, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are ultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's propensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of replicators, characteristic of the transition from nonlife to life. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding life's emergence and evolutionary transitions more broadly. Key Words: Origin of life—Prebiotic evolution—Astrobiology—Biopolymers—Life.

Drawing on the ‘entropic brain’ hypothesis and the ‘RElaxed Beliefs Under pSychedelics’ model, this paper focuses on the richness of psychological experience. Through a complex systems theory perspective, we suggest that psychedelics destabilize fixed points or attractors, breaking reinforced patterns of thinking and behaving. Our approach explains how psychedelic-induced increases in brain entropy destabilize neurophysiological set points and lead to new conceptualizations of psychedelic psychotherapy. These insights have important implications for risk mitigation and treatment optimization in psychedelic medicine, both during the peak psychedelic experience and during the subacute period of potential recovery.},

	abstract = {Bacteria spend their lives buffeted by changing environmental conditions.

These responses are controlled by master regulators, which include: alternative sigma factors, such as RpoS and RpoH; small molecule effectors, such as ppGpp; gene repressors such as LexA; and, inorganic molecules, such as polyphosphate. The response pathways extensively overlap and are induced to various extents by the same environmental stresses. These stresses include nutritional deprivation, DNA damage, temperature shift, and exposure to antibiotics. All of these global stress responses include functions that can increase genetic variability. In particular, up-regulation and activation of error-prone DNA polymerases, down-regulation of error-correcting enzymes, and movement of mobile genetic elements are common features of several stress responses. The result is that under a variety of stressful conditions, bacteria are induced for genetic change. This transient mutator state may be important for adaptive evolution.},

Using viral tracing we found that V1 ChCs predominantly receive monosynaptic input from local layer 5 pyramidal cells and higher-order cortical regions. Two-photon calcium imaging and convolutional neural network modeling revealed that ChCs are visually responsive but weakly selective for stimulus content. In mice running in a virtual tunnel, ChCs respond strongly to events known to elicit arousal, including locomotion and visuomotor mismatch. Repeated exposure of the mice to the virtual tunnel was accompanied by reduced visual responses of ChCs and structural plasticity of ChC boutons and axon initial segment length. Finally, ChCs only weakly inhibited pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that ChCs provide an arousal-related signal to layer 2/3 pyramidal cells that may modulate their activity and/or gate plasticity of their axon initial segments during behaviorally relevant events.},

Entry criteria were broadly defined and inclusive, and patients were enrolled from psychiatric and primary care clinics. All participants began on citalopram and were managed by clinic physicians, who followed an algorithm-guided acute-phase treatment through five visits over 12 weeks. At the end of each sequence, patients whose depression had not fully remitted were eligible for subsequent randomized trials in a sequence of up to three clinical trials. In general, remission rates in the study clinics were lower than expected, suggesting the need for several steps to achieve remission for most patients. There was no clear medication "winner" for patients whose depression did not remit after one or more aggressive medication trials. Both switching and augmenting appeared to be reasonable options when an initial antidepressant treatment failed, although these two strategies could not be directly compared. Further, the likelihood of remission after two vigorous medication trials substantially decreased, and remission would likely require more complicated medication regimens for which the existing evidence base is quite thin. STAR*D demonstrated that inclusion of more real-world patients in clinical trials is both feasible and informative. Policy implications of the findings, as well as the study's limitations, are discussed.},

SSRIs might facilitate relearning through neuroplastic processes and thus exert their clinical effects in psychiatric diseases where cognitive functioning is affected. However, translation of these mechanisms to humans is missing. In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, we assessed functional brain activation during learning and memory retrieval in healthy volunteers performing associative learning tasks aiming to translate facilitated relearning by SSRIs., To this extent, seventy-six participants underwent three MRI scanning sessions: (1) at baseline, (2) after three weeks of daily associative learning and subsequent retrieval (face-matching or Chinese character–noun matching) and (3) after three weeks of relearning under escitalopram (10 mg/day) or placebo. Associative learning and retrieval tasks were performed during each functional MRI (fMRI) session. Statistical modeling was done using a repeated-measures ANOVA, to test for content-by-treatment-by-time interaction effects., During the learning task, a significant substance-by-time interaction was found in the right insula showing a greater deactivation in the SSRI cohort after 21 days of relearning compared to the learning phase. In the retrieval task, there was a significant content-by-time interaction in the left angular gyrus (AG) with an increased activation in face-matching compared to Chinese-character matching for both learning and relearning phases. A further substance-by-time interaction was found in task performance after 21 days of relearning, indicating a greater decrease of performance in the placebo group., Our findings that escitalopram modulate insula activation demonstrates successful translation of relearning as a mechanism of SSRIs in human. Furthermore, we show that the left AG is an active component of correct memory retrieval, which coincides with previous literature. We extend the function of this region by demonstrating its activation is not only stimulus dependent but also time constrained. Finally, we were able to show that escitalopram aids in relearning, irrespective of content.},

	abstract = {Treatment outcomes for major depressive disorder (MDD) need to be improved. Presently, no clinically relevant tools have been established for stratifying subgroups or predicting outcomes. This literature review sought to investigate factors closely linked to outcome and summarize existing and novel strategies for improvement. The results show that early recognition and treatment are crucial, as duration of untreated depression correlates with worse outcomes. Early improvement is associated with response and remission, while comorbidities prolong course of illness. Potential biomarkers have been explored, including hippocampal volumes, neuronal activity of the anterior cingulate cortex, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and central and peripheral inflammatory markers (e.g., translocator protein (TSPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)). However, their integration into routine clinical care has not yet been fully elucidated, and more research is needed in this regard. Genetic findings suggest that testing for CYP450 isoenzyme activity may improve treatment outcomes. Strategies such as managing risk factors, improving clinical trial methodology, and designing structured step-by-step treatments are also beneficial. Finally, drawing on existing guidelines, we outline a sequential treatment optimization paradigm for selecting first-, second-, and third-line treatments for acute and chronically ill patients. Well-established treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) are clinically relevant for treatment-resistant populations, and novel transcranial stimulation methods such as theta-burst stimulation (TBS) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) have shown promising results. Novel rapid-acting antidepressants, such as ketamine, may also constitute a paradigm shift in treatment optimization for MDD.},

	abstract = {Background Delirium is an important risk factor for subsequent dementia. However, the field lacks large studies with long-term follow-up of delirium in subjects initially free of dementia to clearly establish clinical trajectories.
Methods We undertook a retrospective cohort study of all patients over the age of 65 diagnosed with an episode of delirium who were initially dementia free at onset of delirium within National Health Service Greater Glasgow \& Clyde between 1996 and 2020 using the Safe Haven database. We estimated the cumulative incidence of dementia accounting for the competing risk of death without a dementia diagnosis. We modelled the effects of age at delirium diagnosis, sex and socioeconomic deprivation on the cause-specific hazard of dementia via cox regression.
Results 12 949 patients with an incident episode of delirium were included and followed up for an average of 741 days. The estimated cumulative incidence of dementia was 31\% by 5 years. The estimated cumulative incidence of the competing risk of death without dementia was 49.2\% by 5 years. The cause-specific hazard of dementia was increased with higher levels of deprivation and also with advancing age from 65, plateauing and decreasing from age 90. There did not appear to be a relationship with sex.
Conclusions Our study reinforces the link between delirium and future dementia in a large cohort of patients. It highlights the importance of early recognition of delirium and prevention where possible.},

	abstract = {Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection has long been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), but the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of MS is not clear. Our hypothesis is that a major fraction of the expanded clones of T lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are specific for autologous EBV-infected B cells. We obtained blood and CSF samples from eight relapsing-remitting patients in the process of diagnosis. We stimulated cells from the blood with autologous EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), EBV, varicella zoster virus, influenza, and candida and sorted the responding cells with flow cytometry after 6 d. We sequenced the RNA for T cell receptors (TCR) from CSF, unselected blood cells, and the antigen-specific cells. We used the TCR Vβ CDR3 sequences from the antigen-specific cells to assign antigen specificity to the sequences from the CSF and blood. LCL-specific cells comprised 13.0 ± 4.3\% (mean ± SD) of the total reads present in CSF and 13.3 ± 7.5\% of the reads present in blood. The next most abundant antigen specificity was flu, which was 4.7 ± 1.7\% of the reads in the CSF and 9.3 ± 6.6\% in the blood. The prominence of LCL-specific reads was even more marked in the top 1\% most abundant CSF clones with statistically significant 47\% mean overlap with LCL. We conclude that LCL-specific sequences form a major portion of the TCR repertoire in both CSF and blood and that expanded clones specific for LCL are present in MS CSF. This has important implications for the pathogenesis of MS.},

Neuronal activity also evokes non-synaptic activity-dependent potassium currents that are amplified through gap junction-mediated tumor interconnections forming an electrically-coupled network. Glioma membrane depolarization assessed with in vivo optogenetics promotes proliferation, while pharmacologically or genetically blocking electrochemical signaling inhibits glioma xenograft growth and extends mouse survival. Emphasizing positive feedback mechanisms by which gliomas increase neuronal excitability and thus activity-regulated glioma growth, human intraoperative electrocorticography demonstrates increased cortical excitability in glioma-infiltrated brain. Together, these findings indicate that synaptic and electrical integration in neural circuits promotes glioma progression.},

	abstract = {Background
Historically, females have been underrepresented in clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational drugs and devices. We assessed participation by sex in recent clinical trials.
Methods
We extracted data over a 4-year period (2016–2019) from ClinicalTrials.gov on US-based, pharmaceutical industry or government-funded Phase 1–3 clinical trials of drugs and devices. We included trials with adult cardiovascular, psychiatric, and cancer endpoints whose protocol planned to enroll both sexes. Average proportions of females enrolled per trial were described overall and by disease area.
Results
Across 1433 trials including 302,664 participants in our analysis, on average, 41.2\% were female. Females were underrepresented compared with their proportion of the disease population in cardiovascular disease trials (41.9\% female participants vs. 49\% female population with cardiovascular disease). In psychiatry, where females comprise 60\% of patients, the mean participation of females in clinical trials was 42.0\%. Similarly, for cancer trials, where 51\% of patients are female, only 41.0\% of cancer clinical trial participants were female. For each therapeutic area analyzed, the participation of females in clinical trials fell short of the benchmark derived from national prevalence data.
Conclusions
While the participation of females in clinical trials has improved compared to previous reports, sex-based gaps still persist between trial populations and those expected to use these drugs/devices based on distributions of diseases in the population. Given potential sex-based differences in treatment responses and toxicities, adequate inclusion of females in clinical trials remains critical.},

difference in depression across a wide array of nations and ages; 2) use a
developmental perspective to elucidate patterns of gender differences across the
lifespan; and 3) incorporate additional theory-driven moderators (e.g., gender
equity). For major depression diagnoses and depression symptoms, respectively,
we meta-analyzed data from 65 and 95 articles and their corresponding national
datasets, representing data from 1,716,195 and 1,922,064 people in over 90
different nations. Overall, OR = 1.95, 95\% CI [1.88,
2.03] and d = 0.27 [0.26,
0.29]. Age was the strongest predictor of effect size. The gender
difference for diagnoses emerged earlier than previously thought, with OR
= 2.37 at age 12. For both meta-analyses, the gender difference peaked
in adolescence (OR = 3.02 for ages 13–15, and d
= 0.47 for age 16) but then declined and remained stable in adulthood.
Cross-national analyses indicated that larger gender differences were found in
nations with greater gender equity, for major depression, but not depression
symptoms. The gender difference in depression represents a health disparity,
especially in adolescence, yet the magnitude of the difference indicates that
depression in males should not be overlooked.},

Slow-wave activity (SWA) is commonly used to reflect the homeostatic aspect of sleep; although it can indicate sleep pressure, it does not explain why animals need sleep. This study aimed to assess whether criticality may be the computational set point of sleep. By recording cortical neuron activity continuously for 10–14 d in freely behaving rats, we show that normal waking experience progressively disrupts criticality and that sleep functions to restore critical dynamics. Criticality is perturbed in a context-dependent manner, and waking experience is causal in driving these effects. The degree of deviation from criticality predicts future sleep/wake behavior more accurately than SWA, behavioral history or other neural measures. Our results demonstrate that perturbation and recovery of criticality is a network homeostatic mechanism consistent with the core, restorative function of sleep.},

Our understanding of their systematic roles is hampered from the start by the lack of a fundamental means of standardizing the description of complex branching patterns, such as those of neuronal trees. To solve this problem, we have invented the Topological Morphology Descriptor (TMD), a method for encoding the spatial structure of any tree as a “barcode”, a unique topological signature. As opposed to traditional morphometrics, the TMD couples the topology of the branches with their spatial extents by tracking their topological evolution in 3-dimensional space. We prove that neuronal trees, as well as stochastically generated trees, can be accurately categorized based on their TMD profiles. The TMD retains sufficient global and local information to create an unbiased benchmark test for their categorization and is able to quantify and characterize the structural differences between distinct morphological groups. The use of this mathematically rigorous method will advance our understanding of the anatomy and diversity of branching morphologies.},

Their topological structure includes nodes, edges, triangles, and even higher-dimensional objects. Topological data analysis (TDA) is the emerging framework to process data sets under this perspective. In parallel, topology has proven essential for understanding fundamental questions in physics. Here we report the discovery of topological phase transitions in functional brain networks by merging concepts from TDA, topology, geometry, physics, and network theory. We show that topological phase transitions occur when the Euler entropy has a singularity, which remarkably coincides with the emergence of multidimensional topological holes in the brain network. The geometric nature of the transitions can be interpreted, under certain hypotheses, as an extension of percolation to high-dimensional objects. Due to the universal character of phase transitions and noise robustness of TDA, our findings open perspectives toward establishing reliable topological and geometrical markers for group and possibly individual differences in functional brain network organization.},

This is possible because individuals that sustain high EE have a greater energetic capacity (=greater energy acquisition, expenditure and ability to up-regulate output), and can therefore allocate energy to multiple cancer-fighting mechanisms with minimal energetic trade-offs. Our review finds that individuals sustaining high EE have greater antioxidant production, lower oxidative stress, greater immune function and lower cancer incidence. Our hypothesis and literature review suggest that EE may indeed be net protective against cancer, and that individual variation in energetic capacity may be a key mechanism to understand the highly individual nature of cancer risk in contemporary human populations and laboratory animals.Lay summary The process of expending energy generates reactive oxygen species that can lead to oxidative stress, cell and DNA damage, and the accumulation of this damage is thought to be a major contributor to many ageing related diseases that include cancer. Here, we challenge this view, proposing how and why high energy expenditure (EE) may actually be net protective against cancer, and provide literature support for our hypothesis. We find individuals with high sustained EE have greater energetic capacity and thus can invest more in repair to counter oxidative stress, and more in immune function, both of which reduce cancer risk. Our hypothesis provides a novel mechanism to understand the highly individual nature of cancer, why taller individuals are more at risk, why physically active individuals have lower cancer risk, and why regular exercise can reduce cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Disorders of consciousness (DoC) are a challenging and complex group of neurological conditions characterised by absent or impaired awareness. The current range of therapeutic options for DoC patients is limited, offering few non-invasive pharmacological alternatives. This situation has sprung a growing interest in the development of novel treatments, such as the proposal to study the efficacy of 5HT2A receptor agonists (also known as psychedelics) to restore impaired consciousness. Given the ethical implications of exploring novel compounds in non-communicative individuals, we assessed in silico their effects in the whole-brain dynamics of DoC patients. We embedded the whole-brain activity of patients in a low-dimensional space, and then used this representation to visualise the effects of simulated neuromodulation across a range of receptors representing potential drug targets. Our findings show that activation of serotonergic and opioid receptors shifted brain dynamics of DoC patients towards patterns typically seen in conscious and awake individuals, and that this effect was mediated by the brain-wide density of activated receptors. These results showcase the role of whole-brain models in the discovery of novel pharmacological treatments for neuropsychiatric conditions, while also supporting the feasibility of accelerating the recovery of consciousness with serotonergic psychedelics},

While both TMS and ketamine demonstrate high effectiveness in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms, some patients still do not achieve the desired improvement.

They can also have side effects. It is important to discuss the pros and cons of antidepressants with your doctor. The main aim of treatment with antidepressants is to relieve the symptoms of severe depression, such as feeling very down and exhausted, and prevent them from coming back. They are meant to make you feel emotionally stable again and help you to follow a normal daily routine. They are also taken to relieve symptoms such as restlessness, anxiety and sleep problems, and to prevent suicidal thoughts.

However, recent works disagree on whether specialized methods grounded in dynamical systems theory, such as reservoir computers or neural ordinary differential equations, outperform general-purpose large-scale learning methods such as transformers or recurrent neural networks. These prior studies perform comparisons on few individually chosen chaotic systems, thereby precluding robust quantification of how statistical modeling choices and dynamical invariants of different chaotic systems jointly determine empirical predictability. Here, we perform the largest to-date comparative study of forecasting methods on the classical problem of forecasting chaos: we benchmark 24 state-of-the-art forecasting methods on a crowdsourced database of 135 low-dimensional systems with 17 forecast metrics. We find that large-scale, domain-agnostic forecasting methods consistently produce predictions that remain accurate up to two dozen Lyapunov times, thereby accessing a long-horizon forecasting regime well beyond classical methods. We find that, in this regime, accuracy decorrelates with classical invariant measures of predictability like the Lyapunov exponent. However, in data-limited settings outside the long-horizon regime, we find that physics-based hybrid methods retain a comparative advantage due to their strong inductive biases.},

This manuscript is a reference work on the receptor affinity pharmacology of psychedelic drugs. New data is presented on the affinity of twenty-five psychedelic drugs at fifty-one receptors, transporters, and ion channels, assayed by the National Institute of Mental Health – Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (NIMH-PDSP). In addition, comparable data gathered from the literature on ten additional drugs is also presented (mostly assayed by the NIMH-PDSP). A new method is introduced for normalizing affinity (Ki) data that factors out potency so that the multi-receptor affinity profiles of different drugs can be directly compared and contrasted. The method is then used to compare the thirty-five drugs in graphical and tabular form. It is shown that psychedelic drugs, especially phenylalkylamines, are not as selective as generally believed, interacting with forty-two of forty-nine broadly assayed sites. The thirty-five drugs of the study have very diverse patterns of interaction with different classes of receptors, emphasizing eighteen different receptors. This diversity of receptor interaction may underlie the qualitative diversity of these drugs. It should be possible to use this diverse set of drugs as probes into the roles played by the various receptor systems in the human mind.},

How did communication strategies in macroscale brain networks adapt across evolution to accomplish increasingly complex functions? By applying a graph- and information-theory approach to assess information-related pathways in male mouse, macaque and human brains, we show a brain communication gap between selective information transmission in non-human mammals, where brain regions share information through single polysynaptic pathways, and parallel information transmission in humans, where regions share information through multiple parallel pathways. In humans, parallel transmission acts as a major connector between unimodal and transmodal systems. The layout of information-related pathways is unique to individuals across different mammalian species, pointing at the individual-level specificity of information routing architecture. Our work provides evidence that different communication patterns are tied to the evolution of mammalian brain networks.},

	abstract = {Mindfulness meditation is a contemplative practice informed by Buddhism that targets the development of present-focused awareness and non-judgment of experience. Interest in mindfulness is burgeoning, and it has been shown to be effective in improving mental and physical health in clinical and non-clinical contexts. In this report, for the first time, we used electroencephalography (EEG) combined with a neurophenomenological approach to examine the neural signature of “cessation” events, which are dramatic experiences of complete discontinuation in awareness similar to the loss of consciousness, which are reported to be experienced by very experienced meditators, and are proposed to be evidence of mastery of mindfulness meditation. We intensively sampled these cessations as experienced by a single advanced meditator (with over 23,000 h of meditation training) and analyzed 37 cessation events collected in 29 EEG sessions between November 12, 2019, and March 11, 2020. Spectral analyses of the EEG data surrounding cessations showed that these events were marked by a large-scale alpha-power decrease starting around 40 s before their onset, and that this alpha-power was lowest immediately following a cessation. Region-of-interest (ROI) based examination of this finding revealed that this alpha-suppression showed a linear decrease in the occipital and parietal regions of the brain during the pre-cessation time period. Additionally, there were modest increases in theta power for the central, parietal, and right temporal ROIs during the pre-cessation timeframe, whereas power in the Delta and Beta frequency bands were not significantly different surrounding cessations. By relating cessations to objective and intrinsic measures of brain activity (i.e., EEG power) that are related to consciousness and high-level psychological functioning, these results provide evidence for the ability of experienced meditators to voluntarily modulate their state of consciousness and lay the foundation for studying these unique states using a neuroscientific approach.},

Yet, the neural underpinnings of outcome valence in the human brainstem and the extent to which they differ in reward and punishment learning contexts remain largely elusive. Here, using simultaneously acquired electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we show that during reward learning the substantia nigra (SN)/ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus are initially activated following negative outcomes, while the VTA subsequently re-engages exhibiting greater responses for positive than negative outcomes, consistent with an early arousal/avoidance response and a later value-updating process, respectively. During punishment learning, we show that distinct raphe nucleus and SN subregions are activated only by negative outcomes with a sustained post-outcome activity across time, supporting the involvement of these brainstem subregions in avoidance behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the coupling of these brainstem structures with other subcortical and cortical areas helps to shape participants’ serial choice behavior in each context.},

	abstract = {Information storage and retrieval is essential for all life. In biology, information is primarily stored in two distinct ways: the genome, comprising nucleic acids, acts as a foundational blueprint and the epigenome, consisting of chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins, regulates gene expression patterns and endows cells with specific identities and functions. Unlike the stable, digital nature of genetic information, epigenetic information is stored in a digital–analog format, susceptible to alterations induced by diverse environmental signals and cellular damage. The Information Theory of Aging (ITOA) states that the aging process is driven by the progressive loss of youthful epigenetic information, the retrieval of which via epigenetic reprogramming can improve the function of damaged and aged tissues by catalyzing age reversal. This Perspective describes and discusses the Information Theory of Aging, which proposes that aging primarily stems from the loss of youthful epigenetic information that can be restored via epigenetic reprogramming to heal injury and reverse aging.},

Why these initially appear in disparate locations is not understood. Using task-based fMRI and multimodal PET imaging, we assess the impact of local AD pathology on network-to-network interactions. We show that AD pathologies flip interactions between the default mode network (DMN) and the medial temporal lobe (MTL) from inhibitory to excitatory. The DMN is hyperexcited with increasing levels of Aβ, which drives hyperexcitability within the MTL and this directed hyperexcitation of the MTL by the DMN predicts the rate of tau accumulation within the EC. Our results support a model whereby Aβ induces disruptions to local excitatory-inhibitory balance in the DMN, driving hyperexcitability in the MTL, leading to tau accumulation. We propose that Aβ-induced disruptions to excitatory-inhibitory balance is a candidate causal route between Aβ and remote EC-tau accumulation.},

It remains unclear whether this heightened energy demand uniformly supports an enlarged brain or if specific signaling mechanisms necessitate greater energy. We hypothesized that the regional distribution of energy demands will reveal signaling strategies that have contributed to human cognitive development. We measured the energy distribution within the brain functional connectome using multimodal brain imaging and found that signaling pathways in evolutionarily expanded regions have up to 67\% higher energetic costs than those in sensory-motor regions. Additionally, histology, transcriptomic data, and molecular imaging independently reveal an up-regulation of signaling at G-protein-coupled receptors in energy-demanding regions. Our findings indicate that neuromodulator activity is predominantly involved in cognitive functions, such as reading or memory processing. This study suggests that an up-regulation of neuromodulator activity, alongside increased brain size, is a crucial aspect of human brain evolution.},

Representational geometry does not, however, account for how individual neurons implement these representations. Leveraging the principle of sparse coding, we present a framework to dissect representational geometry into biologically interpretable components that retain links to single neurons. Applied to extracellular recordings from the primate prefrontal cortex in a working memory task with interference, the identified components revealed disentangled and sequential memory representations including the recovery of memory content after distraction, signals hidden to conventional analyses. Each component was contributed by small subpopulations of neurons with distinct spiking properties and response dynamics. Modeling showed that such sparse implementations are supported by recurrently connected circuits as in prefrontal cortex. The perspective of neuronal implementation links representational geometries to their cellular constituents, providing mechanistic insights into how neural systems encode and process information.},

	abstract = {While the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated-tau (hp-tau) as two classical histopathological biomarkers are crucial in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), their detailed interaction with the electrophysiological changes at the meso- and macroscale are not yet fully understood. We developed a mechanistic mequltiscale model of AD progression, linking proteinopathy to its effects on neural activity and vice-versa. We integrated a heterodimer model of prion-like protein propagation, and a network of Jansen-Rit electrical oscillators whose model parameters varied due to neurotoxicity. Changes in inhibition guided the electrophysiological alterations found in AD, and both Aβ and hp-tau-related inhibition changes were able to produce similar effects independently. Additionally, we found a causal disconnection between cellular hyperactivity and interregional hypersynchrony. Finally, we demonstrated that early Aβ and hp-tau depositions’ location determine the spatiotemporal profile of the proteinopathy. The presented model combines the molecular effects of bothAβ and hp-tau together with a mechanistic protein propagation model and network effects within a unique closed-loop model. This holds the potential to enlighten the interplay between AD mechanisms on various scales, aiming to develop and test novel hypotheses on the contribution of different AD-related variables to the disease evolution.
Significance Statement This research presents a groundbreaking closed-loop model of AD mechanisms, bridging the gap between protein distribution and neural activity. Contrary to prior assumptions, the study reveals that interregional hyper-synchrony and cellular hyperactivity are not directly linked. Notably, the model identifies neural inhibition as a potential causal factor in neurophysiological AD alterations and posits early depositions of Aβ as a determinant of the spatiotemporal profile of proteinopathy. The significance of this mechanistic disease framework lies in its potential to produce insights into AD evolution and to guide novel treatment strategies. It underscores the importance of further experiments and modelling efforts to refine our understanding of AD, offering hope for more effective treatments and personalized care in the fight against dementia.},

We used Neuropixels 2.0 probe with 384 channels in an in-vivo rat model of TES to detect effects of weak fields on neuronal firing rate. High-density field mapping and computational models verified field intensity (1 V/m in hippocampus per 50 µA of applied skull currents). We demonstrate that electric fields below 0.5 V/m acutely modulate firing rate in 5\% of neurons recorded in the hippocampus. At these intensities, average firing rate effects increased monotonically with electric field intensity at a rate of 7 \% per V/m. For the majority of excitatory neurons, firing increased for cathodal stimulation and diminished for anodal stimulation. While more diverse, the response of inhibitory neurons followed a similar pattern on average, likely as a result of excitatory drive. Our results indicate that responses to TES at clinically relevant intensities are driven by a fraction of high-responder excitatory neurons, with polarity-specific effects. We conclude that transcranial electric stimulation is an effective neuromodulator at clinically realistic intensities.},

This behavioral capability is algorithmically impressive because of the myriad identity-preserving viewpoints and scenes that dramatically change the visual image produced by the same object. Until recently, the brain mechanisms that support that capability were deeply mysterious. However, over the last decade, this scientific mystery has been illuminated by the discovery and development of brain-inspired, image-computable, artificial neural network (ANN) systems that rival primates in this behavioral feat. Apart from fundamentally changing the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), modified versions of these ANN systems are the current leading scientific hypotheses of an integrated set of mechanisms in the primate ventral visual stream that support object recognition. What separates brain-mapped versions of these systems from prior conceptual models is that they are Sensory-computable, Mechanistic, Anatomically Referenced, and Testable (SMART). Here, we review and provide perspective on the brain mechanisms that the currently leading SMART models address. We review the empirical brain and behavioral alignment successes and failures of those current models. Given ongoing advances in neurobehavioral measurements and AI, we discuss the next frontiers for even more accurate mechanistic understanding. And we outline the likely applications of that SMART-model-based understanding.},

	abstract = {Integrating independent but converging lines of research on brain function and neurodevelopment across scales, this article proposes that serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) signalling is an evolutionary and developmental driver and potent modulator of the macroscale functional organization of the human cerebral cortex. A wealth of evidence indicates that the anatomical and functional organization of the cortex follows a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient. Situated at the apex of this processing hierarchy—where it plays a central role in the integrative processes underpinning complex, human-defining cognition—the transmodal cortex has disproportionately expanded across human development and evolution. Notably, the adult human transmodal cortex is especially rich in 5-HT2AR expression and recent evidence suggests that, during early brain development, 5-HT2AR signalling on neural progenitor cells stimulates their proliferation—a critical process for evolutionarily-relevant cortical expansion. Drawing on multimodal neuroimaging and cross-species investigations, we argue that, by contributing to the expansion of the human cortex and being prevalent at the apex of its hierarchy in the adult brain, 5-HT2AR signalling plays a major role in both human cortical expansion and functioning. Owing to its unique excitatory and downstream cellular effects, neuronal 5-HT2AR agonism promotes neuroplasticity, learning and cognitive and psychological flexibility in a context-(hyper)sensitive manner with therapeutic potential. Overall, we delineate a dual role of 5-HT2ARs in enabling both the expansion and modulation of the human transmodal cortex.},

	abstract = {In natural vision, feedback connections support versatile visual inference capabilities such as making sense of the occluded or noisy bottom-up sensory information or mediating pure top-down processes such as imagination. However, the mechanisms by which the feedback pathway learns to give rise to these capabilities flexibly are not clear. We propose that top-down effects emerge through alignment between feedforward and feedback pathways, each optimizing its own objectives. To achieve this co-optimization, we introduce Feedback-Feedforward Alignment (FFA), a learning algorithm that leverages feedback and feedforward pathways as mutual credit assignment computational graphs, enabling alignment. In our study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FFA in co-optimizing classification and reconstruction tasks on widely used MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Notably, the alignment mechanism in FFA endows feedback connections with emergent visual inference functions, including denoising, resolving occlusions, hallucination, and imagination. Moreover, FFA offers bio-plausibility compared to traditional backpropagation (BP) methods in implementation. By repurposing the computational graph of credit assignment into a goal-driven feedback pathway, FFA alleviates weight transport problems encountered in BP, enhancing the bio-plausibility of the learning algorithm. Our study presents FFA as a promising proof-of-concept for the mechanisms underlying how feedback connections in the visual cortex support flexible visual functions. This work also contributes to the broader field of visual inference underlying perceptual phenomena and has implications for developing more biologically inspired learning algorithms.},

Understanding their underpinnings has implications for identifying biomarkers and treatment for these symptoms.To evaluate whether glial markers are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals across the Alzheimer disease continuum.This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2023, leveraging data from the Translational Biomarkers in Aging and Dementia cohort at McGill University, Canada. Recruitment was based on referrals of individuals from the community or from outpatient clinics. Exclusion criteria included active substance abuse, major surgery, recent head trauma, safety contraindications for positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging, being currently enrolled in other studies, and having inadequately treated systemic conditions.All individuals underwent assessment for neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatry Inventory Questionnaire [NPI-Q]), and imaging for microglial activation ([11C]PBR28 PET), amyloid-β ([18F]AZD4694 PET), and tau tangles ([18F]MK6240 PET).Of the 109 participants, 72 (66\%) were women and 37 (34\%) were men; the median age was 71.8 years (range, 38.0-86.5 years). Overall, 70 had no cognitive impairment and 39 had cognitive impairment (25 mild; 14 Alzheimer disease dementia). Amyloid-β PET positivity was present in 21 cognitively unimpaired individuals (30\%) and in 31 cognitively impaired individuals (79\%). The NPI-Q severity score was associated with microglial activation in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices (β = 7.37; 95\% CI, 1.34-13.41; P = .01). A leave-one-out approach revealed that irritability was the NPI-Q domain most closely associated with the presence of brain microglial activation (β = 6.86; 95\% CI, 1.77-11.95; P = .008). Furthermore, we found that microglia-associated irritability was associated with study partner burden measured by NPI-Q distress score (β = 5.72; 95\% CI, 0.33-11.10; P = .03).In this cross-sectional study of 109 individuals across the AD continuum, microglial activation was associated with and a potential biomarker of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer disease.

	abstract = {Rich, spontaneous brain activity has been observed across a range of different temporal and spatial scales. These dynamics are thought to be important for efficient neural functioning. A range of experimental evidence suggests that these neural dynamics are maintained across a variety of different cognitive states, in response to alterations of the environment and to changes in brain configuration (e.g., across individuals, development and in many neurological disorders). This suggests that the brain has evolved mechanisms to maintain rich dynamics across a broad range of situations. Several mechanisms based around homeostatic plasticity have been proposed to explain how these dynamics emerge from networks of neurons at the microscopic scale. Here we explore how a homeostatic mechanism may operate at the macroscopic scale: in particular, focusing on how it interacts with the underlying structural network topology and how it gives rise to well-described functional connectivity networks. We use a simple mean-field model of the brain, constrained by empirical white matter structural connectivity where each region of the brain is simulated using a pool of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We show, as with the microscopic work, that homeostatic plasticity regulates network activity and allows for the emergence of rich, spontaneous dynamics across a range of brain configurations, which otherwise show a very limited range of dynamic regimes. In addition, the simulated functional connectivity of the homeostatic model better resembles empirical functional connectivity network. To accomplish this, we show how the inhibitory weights adapt over time to capture important graph theoretic properties of the underlying structural network. Therefore, this work presents suggests how inhibitory homeostatic mechanisms facilitate stable macroscopic dynamics to emerge in the brain, aiding the formation of functional connectivity networks.},

Here we use a slice preparation of rat primary visual cortex to show that 2 d of prior visual deprivation early in life increases the excitability of layer 4 circuitry. Slice recordings showed that spontaneous activity of layer 4 star pyramidal neurons increased 25-fold after 2 d of visual deprivation between postnatal days (P) 15 and P17. This effect was mediated by increased net excitatory and decreased net inhibitory synaptic drive. Paired recordings showed that excitatory connections between star pyramidal neurons doubled in amplitude, whereas inhibitory connections decreased or increased depending on the interneuron class. These effects reversed when vision was restored. This dynamic adjustment of the excitation-inhibition balance may allow the networks within layer 4 to maintain stable levels of activity in the face of variable sensory input.},

Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner3,4. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (γ-aminutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period mESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such ‘synaptic scaling’ may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs5, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification6,7 and facilitating competition between synapses7,8,9.},

This observation is known as Peto's paradox. How much would evolution have to change the parameters of somatic evolution in order to equalize the cancer risk between species that differ by orders of magnitude in size? Analysis of previously published models of colorectal cancer suggests that a two- to three-fold decrease in the mutation rate or stem cell division rate is enough to reduce a whale's cancer risk to that of a human. Similarly, the addition of one to two required tumour-suppressor gene mutations would also be sufficient. We surveyed mammalian genomes and did not find a positive correlation of tumour-suppressor genes with increasing body mass and longevity. However, we found evidence of the amplification of TP53 in elephants, MAL in horses and FBXO31 in microbats, which might explain Peto's paradox in those species. Exploring parameters that evolution may have fine-tuned in large, long-lived organisms will help guide future experiments to reveal the underlying biology responsible for Peto's paradox and guide cancer prevention in humans.},

Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species, and on long-standing hypotheses about the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found that somatic mutagenesis was dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans8, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Notably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied showing a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species we examined—including variation of around 30-fold in lifespan and around 40,000-fold in body mass—the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of around 3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals, and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a contributing factor in ageing.},

In the present study, for a comparative assessment of the sensitivity of the bottlenose dolphin's electroreceptive system, we determined detection thresholds for DC and AC electric fields with two bottlenose dolphins. In a psychophysical experiment, the animals were trained to respond to electric field stimuli using the go/no-go paradigm. We show that the two bottlenose dolphins are able to detect DC electric fields as low as 2.4 and 5.5 µV cm−1, respectively, a detection threshold in the same order of magnitude as those in the platypus and the Guiana dolphin. Detection thresholds for AC fields (1, 5 and 25 Hz) were generally higher than those for DC fields, and the sensitivity for AC fields decreased with increasing frequency. Although the electroreceptive sensitivity of dolphins is lower than that of elasmobranchs, it is suggested that it allows for both micro- and macro-scale orientation. In dolphins pursuing benthic foraging strategies, electroreception may facilitate short-range prey detection and target-oriented snapping of their prey. Furthermore, the ability to detect weak electric fields may enable dolphins to perceive the Earth's magnetic field through induction-based magnetoreception, thus allowing large-scale orientation.},

Only a few studies have reported successful visualization of mental imagery, and their visualizable images have been limited to specific domains such as human faces or alphabetical letters. Therefore, visualizing mental imagery for arbitrary natural images stands as a significant milestone. In this study, we achieved this by enhancing a previous method. Specifically, we demonstrated that the visual image reconstruction method proposed in the seminal study by Shen et al. (2019) heavily relied on low-level visual information decoded from the brain and could not efficiently utilize the semantic information that would be recruited during mental imagery. To address this limitation, we extended the previous method to a Bayesian estimation framework and introduced the assistance of semantic information into it. Our proposed framework successfully reconstructed both seen images (i.e., those observed by the human eye) and imagined images from brain activity. Quantitative evaluation showed that our framework could identify seen and imagined images highly accurately compared to the chance accuracy (seen: 90.7\%, imagery: 75.6\%, chance accuracy: 50.0\%). In contrast, the previous method could only identify seen images (seen: 64.3\%, imagery: 50.4\%). These results suggest that our framework would provide a unique tool for directly investigating the subjective contents of the brain such as illusions, hallucinations, and dreams.},

Targets were identified using resting-state fMRI scans seeding the sgACC to identify individualized connectivity clusters.

TMS-evoked fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the sgACC and depression symptom scores were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Pre-intervention TMS-evoked response magnitude in the sgACC predicted depression improvement, with more negative evoked responses being associated with greater clinical improvement. Larger post-intervention changes in evoked responses were also associated with depression improvement. The prognostic sgACC associations were specific to the intervention pathway and significantly associated with depression but not anxiety improvement. Here we demonstrate causal evidence of sgACC engagement with TMS/fMRI and show the clinical relevance of engagement and modulation of the targeted prefrontal–sgACC circuit.

“Big fish: Aren’t these waters fascinating and treacherous? Small fish: What waters?” – Anonymous

Richard Feynman is notorious for his witty quotes, including that “philosophy of science is about as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds.” Indeed, some neuroscientists would look perplexed in front of analytic accounts of their own practices, methods, and foundations. Starlings fly by flapping their feathered wings and yet, regardless of their individual skills and collective choreographies, they may be ignorant about how and why they do it.

A tweet-long crash course in philosophy of science could suffice to realize that binary thinking (“Is it true or not?”) coupled with naive empiricism (“just bring more data and let it speak”) is farcical. We need theories not only to frame our findings but to look for them in the first place. In fact, any piece of scientific instrumentation can be seen as a prodigious feat of theory crystallization. Moreover, data does not speak for itself, we articulate its meaning via our interpretations. These, in turn, depend on our initial presuppositions, cognitive biases, and philosophical commitments. If data are “given” ( datum , in Latin), facts are “made” ( factum ). And understanding comes later, on developing a basis on which to “under” “stand” the facts that are made.

Questions about where the precise threshold of evidence lies, or who carries the burden of proof, are not easy either. Just think of currently vexing topics such as …},

	abstract = {A chief goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that think like people. Yet it has been argued that deep neural network architectures fail to accomplish this. Researchers have asserted these models' limitations in the domains of causal reasoning, intuitive physics, and intuitive psychology. Yet recent advancements, namely the rise of large language models, particularly those designed for visual processing, have rekindled interest in the potential to emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This paper evaluates the current state of vision-based large language models in the domains of intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology. Through a series of controlled experiments, we investigate the extent to which these modern models grasp complex physical interactions, causal relationships, and intuitive understanding of others' preferences. Our findings reveal that, while these models demonstrate a notable proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data, they still fall short of human capabilities in these areas. The models exhibit a rudimentary understanding of physical laws and causal relationships, but their performance is hindered by a lack of deeper insights-a key aspect of human cognition. Furthermore, in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind, the models fail altogether. Our results emphasize the need for integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into modern-day, vision-based language models, and point out the importance of cognitively-inspired benchmarks.},

By the end of 2022, 205 trials of tES or TMS in the treatment of substance use disorders had been published, with heterogeneous results, and there is still no consensus on the optimal target brain region. Recent work may help clarify where and how to apply stimulation, owing to expanding databases of neuroimaging studies, new systematic reviews, and improved methods for causal brain mapping. Whereas most previous clinical trials targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, accumulating data highlight the frontopolar cortex as a promising therapeutic target for transcranial brain stimulation in substance use disorders. This approach is supported by converging multimodal evidence, including lesion-based maps, functional MRI-based maps, tES studies, TMS studies, and dose-response relationships. This review highlights the importance of targeting the frontopolar area and tailoring the treatment according to interindividual variations in brain state and trait and electric field distribution patterns. This converging evidence supports the potential for treatment optimization through context, target, dose, and timing dimensions to improve clinical outcomes of transcranial brain stimulation in people with substance use disorders in future clinical trials.},

Previous research has demonstrated bidirectional interactions between neurons and glioma cells, with neuronal activity driving glioma growth– and gliomas increasing neuronal excitability,–. Here we sought to determine how glioma-induced neuronal changes influence neural circuits underlying cognition and whether these interactions influence patient survival. Using intracranial brain recordings during lexical retrieval language tasks in awake humans together with site-specific tumour tissue biopsies and cell biology experiments, we find that gliomas remodel functional neural circuitry such that task-relevant neural responses activate tumour-infiltrated cortex well beyond the cortical regions that are normally recruited in the healthy brain. Site-directed biopsies from regions within the tumour that exhibit high functional connectivity between the tumour and the rest of the brain are enriched for a glioblastoma subpopulation that exhibits a distinct synaptogenic and neuronotrophic phenotype. Tumour cells from functionally connected regions secrete the synaptogenic factor thrombospondin-1, which contributes to the differential neuron–glioma interactions observed in functionally connected tumour regions compared with tumour regions with less functional connectivity. Pharmacological inhibition of thrombospondin-1 using the FDA-approved drug gabapentin decreases glioblastoma proliferation. The degree of functional connectivity between glioblastoma and the normal brain negatively affects both patient survival and performance in language tasks. These data demonstrate that high-grade gliomas functionally remodel neural circuits in the human brain, which both promotes tumour progression and impairs cognition., High-grade gliomas functionally remodel neural circuits in the human brain, promoting tumour progression and impairing cognition.},

	abstract = {In recent years, by leveraging more data, computation, and diverse tasks, learned optimizers have achieved remarkable success in supervised learning, outperforming classical hand-designed optimizers. Reinforcement learning (RL) is essentially different from supervised learning and in practice these learned optimizers do not work well even in simple RL tasks. We investigate this phenomenon and identity three issues. First, the gradients of an RL agent vary across a wide range in logarithms while their absolute values are in a small range, making neural networks hard to obtain accurate parameter updates. Second, the agent-gradient distribution is non-independent and identically distributed, leading to inefficient meta-training. Finally, due to highly stochastic agent-environment interactions, the agent-gradients have high bias and variance, which increase the difficulty of learning an optimizer for RL. We propose gradient processing, pipeline training, and a novel optimizer structure with good inductive bias to address these issues. By applying these techniques, for the first time, we show that learning an optimizer for RL from scratch is possible. Although only trained in toy tasks, our learned optimizer can generalize to unseen complex tasks in Brax.},

	abstract = {This review updates and consolidates evidence on the safety of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Safety is here operationally defined by, and limited to, the absence of evidence for a Serious Adverse Effect, the criteria for which are rigorously defined. This review adopts an evidence-based approach, based on an aggregation of experience from human trials, taking care not to confuse speculation on potential hazards or lack of data to refute such speculation with evidence for risk. Safety data from animal tests for tissue damage are reviewed with systematic consideration of translation to humans. Arbitrary safety considerations are avoided. Computational models are used to relate dose to brain exposure in humans and animals. We review relevant dose-response curves and dose metrics (e.g. current, duration, current density, charge, charge density) for meaningful safety standards. Special consideration is given to theoretically vulnerable populations including children and the elderly, subjects with mood disorders, epilepsy, stroke, implants, and home users. Evidence from relevant animal models indicates that brain injury by Direct Current Stimulation (DCS) occurs at predicted brain current densities (6.3-13 A/m(2)) that are over an order of magnitude above those produced by conventional tDCS. To date, the use of conventional tDCS protocols in human trials (≤40 min, ≤4 milliamperes, ≤7.2 Coulombs) has not produced any reports of a Serious Adverse Effect or irreversible injury across over 33,200 sessions and 1000 subjects with repeated sessions. This includes a wide variety of subjects, including persons from potentially vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {Low intensity transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in humans, encompassing transcranial direct current (tDCS), transcutaneous spinal Direct Current Stimulation (tsDCS), transcranial alternating current (tACS), and transcranial random noise (tRNS) stimulation or their combinations, appears to be safe. No serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported so far in over 18,000 sessions administered to healthy subjects, neurological and psychiatric patients, as summarized here. Moderate adverse events (AEs), as defined by the necessity to intervene, are rare, and include skin burns with tDCS due to suboptimal electrode-skin contact. Very rarely mania or hypomania was induced in patients with depression (11 documented cases), yet a causal relationship is difficult to prove because of the low incidence rate and limited numbers of subjects in controlled trials. Mild AEs (MAEs) include headache and fatigue following stimulation as well as prickling and burning sensations occurring during tDCS at peak-to-baseline intensities of 1-2mA and during tACS at higher peak-to-peak intensities above 2mA. The prevalence of published AEs is different in studies specifically assessing AEs vs. those not assessing them, being higher in the former. AEs are frequently reported by individuals receiving placebo stimulation. The profile of AEs in terms of frequency, magnitude and type is comparable in healthy and clinical populations, and this is also the case for more vulnerable populations, such as children, elderly persons, or pregnant women. Combined interventions (e.g., co-application of drugs, electrophysiological measurements, neuroimaging) were not associated with further safety issues. Safety is established for low-intensity 'conventional' TES defined as {\textless}4mA, up to 60min duration per day. Animal studies and modeling evidence indicate that brain injury could occur at predicted current densities in the brain of 6.3-13A/m2 that are over an order of magnitude above those produced by tDCS in humans. Using AC stimulation fewer AEs were reported compared to DC. In specific paradigms with amplitudes of up to 10mA, frequencies in the kHz range appear to be safe. In this paper we provide structured interviews and recommend their use in future controlled studies, in particular when trying to extend the parameters applied. We also discuss recent regulatory issues, reporting practices and ethical issues. These recommendations achieved consensus in a meeting, which took place in Göttingen, Germany, on September 6-7, 2016 and were refined thereafter by email correspondence.},

Here, we bridge microscale molecular chemoarchitecture and pharmacologically induced macroscale functional reorganization, by relating the regional distribution of 19 neurotransmitter receptors and transporters obtained from positron emission tomography, and the regional changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity induced by 10 different mind-altering drugs: propofol, sevoflurane, ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ayahuasca, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), modafinil, and methylphenidate. Our results reveal a many-to-many mapping between psychoactive drugs’ effects on brain function and multiple neurotransmitter systems. The effects of both anesthetics and psychedelics on brain function are organized along hierarchical gradients of brain structure and function. Last, we show that regional co-susceptibility to pharmacological interventions recapitulates co-susceptibility to disorder-induced structural alterations. Collectively, these results highlight rich statistical patterns relating molecular chemoarchitecture and drug-induced reorganization of the brain’s functional architecture.},

	abstract = {1The relationship between the acute effects of psychedelics and their persisting neurobiological and psychological effects is poorly understood. Here, we tracked brain changes with longitudinal precision functional mapping in healthy adults before, during, and for up to 3 weeks after oral psilocybin and methylphenidate (17 MRI visits per participant) and again 6+ months later. Psilocybin disrupted connectivity across cortical networks and subcortical structures, producing more than 3-fold greater acute changes in functional networks than methylphenidate. These changes were driven by desynchronization of brain activity across spatial scales (area, network, whole brain). Psilocybin-driven desynchronization was observed across association cortex but strongest in the default mode network (DMN), which is connected to the anterior hippocampus and thought to create our sense of self. Performing a perceptual task reduced psilocybin-induced network changes, suggesting a neurobiological basis for grounding, connecting with physical reality during psychedelic therapy. The acute brain effects of psilocybin are consistent with distortions of space-time and the self. Psilocybin induced persistent decrease in functional connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and cortex (and DMN in particular), lasting for weeks but normalizing after 6 months. Persistent suppression of hippocampal-DMN connectivity represents a candidate neuroanatomical and mechanistic correlate for psilocybin's pro-plasticity and anti-depressant effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has agonist activity at various serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown.
METHODS: We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over studyduring which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 µg po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps.
RESULTS: LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD’s neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD’s mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

Little is known about the neuronal correlates of altered states of consciousness induced by this substance. Limited previous studies indicated profound changes in functional connectivity of resting state networks after the administration of LSD. The current investigation attempts to replicate and extend those findings in an independent sample. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 100 μg LSD and placebo were orally administered to 20 healthy participants. Resting state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Within-network and between-network connectivity measures of ten established resting state networks were compared between drug conditions. Complementary analysis were conducted using resting state networks as sources in seed-to-voxel analyses. Acute LSD administration significantly decreased functional connectivity within visual, sensorimotor and auditory networks and the default mode network. While between-network connectivity was widely increased and all investigated networks were affected to some extent, seed-to-voxel analyses consistently indicated increased connectivity between networks and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) and cortical (precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex) hub structures. These latter observations are consistent with findings on the importance of hubs in psychopathological states, especially in psychosis, and could underlay therapeutic effects of hallucinogens as proposed by a recent model.},

	abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the prototypical “psychedelic,” may be unique among psychoactive substances. In the decades that followed its discovery, the magnitude of its effect on science, the arts, and society was unprecedented. LSD produces profound, sometimes life-changing experiences in microgram doses, making it a particularly powerful scientific tool. Here we sought to examine its effects on brain activity, using cutting-edge and complementary neuroimaging techniques in the first modern neuroimaging study of LSD. Results revealed marked changes in brain blood flow, electrical activity, and network communication patterns that correlated strongly with the drug’s hallucinatory and other consciousness-altering properties. These results have implications for the neurobiology of consciousness and for potential applications of LSD in psychological research., Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD’s marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug’s other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of “ego-dissolution” and “altered meaning,” implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of “self” or “ego” and its processing of “meaning.” Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness-altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.},

The core thesis is that compositional sparsity of the underlying regression function – thus an hypothesis about the task to be learned – is the key principle of machine learning. I discuss the thesis (with S. Lloyd) that all learnable functions must be compositionally sparse. Sparsity of the target functions then naturally leads to sparse networks and sparsity-biased optimization techniques. I argue that this is the case of transformers, through the self-attention layers, implementing a ﬂexible version of sparsity (that is, selecting which input tokens interact in the MLP layer). For more classical feedforward multilayer networks, 2 optimization can also be used when the sparsity of the target function is known and is reﬂected in the architecture of the network, as it is the case for CNNs.},

As our ability to record large neural and behavioural data increases, there is growing interest in modelling neural dynamics during adaptive behaviours to probe neural representations1–3. In particular, although neural latent embeddings can reveal underlying correlates of behaviour, we lack nonlinear techniques that can explicitly and flexibly leverage joint behaviour and neural data to uncover neural dynamics3–5. Here, we fill this gap with a new encoding method, CEBRA, that jointly uses behavioural and neural data in a (supervised) hypothesis- or (self-supervised) discovery-driven manner to produce both consistent and high-performance latent spaces. We show that consistency can be used as a metric for uncovering meaningful differences, and the inferred latents can be used for decoding. We validate its accuracy and demonstrate our tool’s utility for both calcium and electrophysiology datasets, across sensory and motor tasks and in simple or complex behaviours across species. It allows leverage of single- and multi-session datasets for hypothesis testing or can be used label free. Lastly, we show that CEBRA can be used for the mapping of space, uncovering complex kinematic features, for the production of consistent latent spaces across two-photon and Neuropixels data, and can provide rapid, high-accuracy decoding of natural videos from visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Shape dynamics is a completely background-independent universal framework of dynamical theories from which all absolute elements have been eliminated. For particles, only the variables that describe the shapes of the instantaneous particle configurations are dynamical. In the case of Riemannian three-geometries, the only dynamical variables are the parts of the metric that determine angles. The local scale factor plays no role. This leads to a shape-dynamic theory of gravity in which the four-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity is replaced by three-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and three-dimensional conformal invariance. Despite this difference of symmetry groups, it is remarkable that the predictions of the two theories -- shape dynamics and general relativity -- agree on spacetime foliations by hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature. However, the two theories are distinct, with shape dynamics having a much more restrictive set of solutions. There are indications that the symmetry group of shape dynamics makes it more amenable to quantization and thus to the creation of quantum gravity. This introduction presents in simple terms the arguments for shape dynamics, its implementation techniques, and a survey of existing results.},

	abstract = {The revolutionary discovery of resting state networks radically shifted the focus from the role of local regions in cognitive tasks to the ongoing spontaneous dynamics in global networks. Yet, there is a growing realisation that these resting state networks could be a bit like the shadow tracings in Plato’s famous cave, perhaps mere epiphenomena of an underlying hidden space from where these shadows emanate. Here we used deep variational auto-encoders to extract manifolds of low dimensionality from whole-brain dynamics measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Crucially, we constructed the first dynamical model of the low dimensional manifold modes, i.e., networks of nodes using non-linear oscillators coupled with the effective functional connectivity, taking into account the level of non-equilibrium dynamics quantified by the non-reversibility of the signals. Irrespective of parcellation size, we found an optimal number of roughly ten manifold modes to best describe the whole-brain activity. Importantly, compared to traditional whole-brain modelling using all the nodes in a parcellation, we obtained better results for resting and task activity by modelling the dynamics of the coupled manifold modes. These findings show the key causal role of manifolds as a fundamental organising principle of brain function at the whole-brain scale, providing evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of the brain.},

	abstract = {A simple design recipe for deep Transformers is to compose identical building blocks. But standard transformer blocks are far from simple, interweaving attention and MLP sub-blocks with skip connections \& normalisation layers in precise arrangements. This complexity leads to brittle architectures, where seemingly minor changes can significantly reduce training speed, or render models untrainable. In this work, we ask to what extent the standard transformer block can be simplified? Combining signal propagation theory and empirical observations, we motivate modifications that allow many block components to be removed with no loss of training speed, including skip connections, projection or value parameters, sequential sub-blocks and normalisation layers. In experiments on both autoregressive decoder-only and BERT encoder-only models, our simplified transformers emulate the per-update training speed and performance of standard transformers, while enjoying 15\% faster training throughput, and using 15\% fewer parameters.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been debate about the effectiveness of treatments from different fields, such as neurostimulation, neurofeedback, brain training, and pharmacotherapy. This debate has been fuelled by contradictory and nuanced experimental findings. Notably, the effectiveness of a given treatment is commonly evaluated by comparing the effect of the active treatment versus the placebo on human health and/or behaviour. However, this approach neglects the individual’s subjective experience of the type of treatment s/he received in establishing treatment efficacy. Here, we show that individual differences in subjective treatment—the thought of receiving the active or placebo condition during an experiment—can explain variability in outcomes better than the actual treatment. We analysed four independent datasets (N=387 participants), including clinical patients and healthy adults from different age groups who were exposed to different neurostimulation treatments (transcranial magnetic stimulation: Study 1 \& 2; transcranial direct current stimulation: Study 3 \& 4). Our findings consistently show that the inclusion of subjective treatment provides a better model fit than objective treatment alone—the condition to which participants are assigned in the experiment. These results demonstrate the significant contribution of subjective experience in explaining the variability of clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Based on these findings, we advocate for existing and future studies in clinical and non-clinical research to start accounting for participants’ subjective beliefs when assessing the efficacy of treatments. This approach will be crucial in providing a more accurate estimation of the treatment effect and its source, allowing the development of effective and reproducible interventions.We demonstrate that individual differences in subjective treatment—the belief of receiving the active or placebo condition during an experiment—can explain variability in research outcomes better than objective treatment, the actual treatment to which participants are assigned. Even though it is a standard practice for intervention studies to collect data on subjective treatment, its contribution to research outcomes has been overlooked. By demonstrating the explanatory power of subjective treatment beyond objective treatment in four independent datasets, we show its potential to provide further insights into the effectiveness of different interventions. We, therefore, encourage researchers to adopt our approach in existing and new studies, to improve experimental design and ultimately increase the rigour and robustness of clinical and non-clinical interventions.},

	abstract = {Cultural transmission is the domain-general social skill that allows agents to acquire and use information from each other in real-time with high fidelity and recall. It can be thought of as the process that perpetuates fit variants in cultural evolution. In humans, cultural evolution has led to the accumulation and refinement of skills, tools and knowledge across generations. We provide a method for generating cultural transmission in artificially intelligent agents, in the form of few-shot imitation. Our agents succeed at real-time imitation of a human in novel contexts without using any pre-collected human data. We identify a surprisingly simple set of ingredients sufficient for generating cultural transmission and develop an evaluation methodology for rigorously assessing it. This paves the way for cultural evolution to play an algorithmic role in the development of artificial general intelligence.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/9q7f4},
	abstract = {The complexity of natural environments requires highly flexible mechanisms for adaptive processing. Furthermore, the processing of single and multiple stimuli is strongly context and goal dependent. The large repertoire of frequencies and waveforms of what is commonly referred to as neuronal oscillations could be an ideal candidate for implementing such flexibility in neural systems. Here we present a framework in which highly dynamic multiplexing and phase coding schemes underlie and structure the attention-guided processing of complex visual scenes. Importantly, we suggest that the dynamic fluctu- ations of excitability vary rapidly in terms of magnitude, frequency and wave-form over time, i.e. they are not necessarily sustained oscillations. We propose that different elements of a single object should be processed within a single cycle (or burst) of alpha band activity (7−14 Hz). This allows for the formation of coherent object representations while simultaneously separating multiple objects across multiple alpha cycles. Each element (e.g. the eyes or ears of the object cat) would still be processed separately in time - expressed as different gamma band bursts ({\textgreater} 30 Hz) - along the alpha phase. Since the processing capacity per alpha cycle is limited, an inverse relationship between object resolution and size of atten- tional spotlight ensures independence of the proposed mechanism from absolute object complexity. The specific frequency and wave-shape of the respective fluctuations involved would depend on the nature of the object that is processed and on cognitive demands. Additionally, we suggest that the processing of multiple objects would further be organized along the phase of flexible slower fluctuations (e.g. delta or theta). Complex scene processing and exploration, involving covert attention and eye movements, would therefore be associated with multiple frequency changes, both in the alpha and lower frequency range. This framework therefore embraces the idea of a hierarchical organization of visual scene processing, independent of the temporal dynamics of the environment.},
